Benioff, chairman and CEO of Salesforce, adding that \"if anything trumps trust, we're in trouble\".\nAmazon's Alexa now has a built-in camera that can rate what a person is wearing, recommend upgrades to their wardrobe and order with a single click. Is it right that technology not only does things for us, but also decides things for us?\nOnline retailers such as Amazon now gather so much data that they know more about users than the users themselves, raising serious questions about the privacy of that data and who has the authority to use and monetize it.\nAccording to Benioff, the signs are pointing towards more regulation.\n\"When CEOs don't take responsibility, then governments have no choice but to step in,\" he said.\nBenioff likened the accelerating power of today's technology to the complex financial products of a decade ago. Regulators weren't paying sufficient attention then, and the headlong rush into mortgage-backed derivatives and the like created the worst financial crash for generations.\n\"Regulators need to adapt much faster to the new reality,\" he stressed.\nThere is a political angle to this argument too, said Sir Martin Sorrell, CEO of British company WPP, one of the world's largest advertising companies, adding that the spread of artificial intelligence, driverless cars and stores with no workers or check-outs is making ordinary people nervous, because their job will be in danger.\n\"With the tech space increasingly dominated by a handful of huge players, such as Apple, Google and Facebook, regulation of data sharing, privacy and responsibility for platform content is an increasingly urgent issue,\" Sorrell argued.\nThe World Economic Forum's 48th Annual Meeting is taking place on Jan. 23-26 in Davos-Klosters, Switzerland, with more than 3,000 leaders from around the world expecting to attend some 400 discussions.\nIn pics: Taikonaut Corps of PLA\nLaba Festival marked around China\n23 French departments on orange alert on floods risk\nFuneral of Dolores O'Riordan held in Limerick\nScenery of snow-covered Crescent spring and Mingsha Mountain\nTianjin greets first snowfall this winter\nTurkish troops enter Syria's Afrin on second day of offensive\nDPRK sends advance team of orchestra for concerts during South Korea-hosted Winter Olympics\n"}

And although Liu He is no stranger to the annual gathering of the world’s business and political elite, he has not previously been the one giving the speech.\nOn Wednesday, Liu – who is a strong candidate to take charge of the country’s economy for the next five years – told the world’s rich and powerful in the Swiss resort town that China would open its domestic markets wider and that this year’s reform measures could “exceed the international community’s expectations”.\nLiu, 66, is leading the Chinese delegation at the World Economic Forum, and he has been given the same status as the most important leaders. He is the only policymaker who is not a state leader to speak in one of 10 sessions hosted by executive chairman Klaus Schwab. Other speakers to take the chair beside Schwab include US President Donald Trump, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, UK Prime Minister Theresa May, French President Emmanuel Macron and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi.\n\nWednesday’s speech also marks the first time Liu – who is seen as the brains behind Xi’s supply-side structural reform concept – has spoken at length in public about the country’s future economic direction since he was introduced by Xi to a visiting US delegation in 2013 as a person who was “very important to me”.\nLiu is the director of the Office of the Central Leading Group for Financial and Economic Affairs and a vice-chairman of the top planning body, the National Development and Reform Commission.\nHow Liu He went from government researcher to Xi’s right-hand man\nSince Liu was elevated to the 25-member Politburo at the 19th party congress in October, it has been widely expected that he would take a front seat in steering the Chinese economy.\nThe Harvard-educated technocrat, who has until now stayed mainly behind the scenes, could be made China’s vice-premier in charge of economic and financial affairs in March.\nAnalysts said the annual Davos meeting was the perfect stage for Liu to make his debut.\n“Liu has been the man behind China’s main economic and financial policies in recent years, like a Chinese version of Larry Summers,” Zhao Xijun, a finance professor with Renmin University said, referring to the former director of the National Economic Council to president Barack Obama.\nLi Keqiang calls for more targeted tack on economic overhaul\n“He’s a suitable person to communicate China’s economic blueprint and its commitments to globalisation and market opening to the world” because of his deep understanding of the Chinese economy and experience in drafting policies, Zhao said.\nLiu, who delivered his half-hour speech in Mandarin, said China’s economy was improving and the country was on course to become wealthier. He also called for joint efforts to address global issues ranging from climate change to fighting terrorism.\n“History may repeat itself when we find we’re at a similar crossroads,” Liu said. “At that moment, making cautious and rational choices will be very important as no country alone can win the battle against terrorism and the double-edged sword of technological development.”\nThis year’s Davos meeting could be the pivot for global trade\nIt is not the first time Liu has attended the ritzy gathering, but last year he was in the audience listening to Xi championing free trade and globalisation.\n“A trade war will only lead to suffering on both sides,” Xi told thousands of business and political leaders a year ago, in a speech widely read as criticism of Trump and a symbol of China’s growing influence on the world stage.\nAnd like most of his other overseas trips with Xi, Liu did not make any public comments at the time.\nBack in 1993, he attended Davos for the first time as a junior government official and took part in a round-table debate about the future of the world economy.\n“I was the lowest-ranking official at the table but got most of the questions,” Liu was quoted as saying in 2008.\nFast-forward to 2018, and Liu is now the face of the world’s second biggest economy at the event, and he is promising change.\n“China’s reform and opening up started in 1978 and has created China’s economic growth miracle,” Liu said. “The best way of commemorating the 40th anniversary is to launch more forceful measures.”\nNarendra Modi tells World Economic Forum globalisation is losing its lustre\nHis remarks come after China recorded 6.9 per cent growth in gross domestic product last year – faster than the official target of around 6.5 per cent. Beijing has also stabilised the yuan exchange rate with capital curbs, ending a sharp currency depreciation seen in the second half of 2015 and in 2016 after missteps in adjusting the rate.\nIn China’s annual closed-door economic conference last month, the top leadership singled out three main tasks for the next three years: controlling financial risk, reducing poverty and curbing pollution. These key “battles” are in line with Liu’s thoughts laid out in his most recent academic paper, published in 2013, when he gave his explanation of the structural reasons for the 2008 global financial crisis and the Great Depression. He wrote that populism, loose monetary policies and an excessively large income gap were to blame for the crisis. “A Comparative Study of Two Global Crises” earned Liu China’s top economics award in 2014.\nYou are signed up.

There has never been a better time to hire, to build, to invest and to grow in the United States. America is open for business and we are competitive once again,” he told the audience of business and political leaders in the Swiss ski resort.\nPutting ‘America first’ will benefit the world, Trump claims in Davos speech\nTaking credit for economic growth in the US, Trump emphasised tax cuts and deregulation as drawcards for investment while again criticising countries he said exploited the system through “predatory behaviours”.\n“The United States will no longer turn a blind eye to unfair economic practices including massive intellectual property theft, industrial subsidies and pervasive state-led economic planning,” he said.\nAlthough he did not name China, analysts said Trump was clearly pointing the finger at Beijing, which he sees as a major competitor.\nWhat are the trade cards Donald Trump could play against China?\n“He changed his tone a little for the audience, but not the substance of his message. And he is taking significant economic measures against China irrespective of this speech,” said Shi Yinhong, who specialises in US studies at Renmin University in Beijing.\n“So Beijing won’t be impressed by this speech – instead it will be closely watching and should be ready to respond to his actions.”\nBefore Trump’s trip to Davos, the US on Monday announced steep tariffs of 30 per cent on imported washing machines and solar panels, which will hurt China – the world’s biggest producer of solar panels – and South Korea the most.\n\n“It looks like a trade war is a possibility,” said Jia Qingguo, head of international studies at Peking University.\nThis week, a US National Security Council spokesman said Trump had reiterated that the US would “use all available trade remedies to create a level playing field for United States workers and businesses”.\nIn the meantime, US tax and interest rate policies to attract multinationals could also hit other countries in the short term, and the analysts said China will be under pressure in both its real economy and foreign exchange controls.\nChina should also be ready to retaliate against trade restrictions, they said, and could also consider tax reforms to make the investment climate more appealing.\n“But it is also important for Beijing to keep up close and constant communication with Washington, to remind Trump that these moves are harmful to America as well,” Jia said.\nIn his speech, Trump insisted on negotiating bilaterally with trading partners, but he also said he would consider talks with the 11 remaining members of the Trans-Pacific Partnership “either individually, or perhaps as a group, if it is in the interests of all”.\nChina way more protectionist than US, says Trump official\nTrump’s first presidential order after he was sworn in last year was to withdraw from the trade pact linking nations around the Asia-Pacific region.\nScott Kennedy from the Centre for Strategic and International Studies said the reference to the TPP was the most unexpected part in the speech.\n“This shows that the administration is now clearly aware that it is in a fight with Beijing for the hearts, minds and wallets of countries in the Asia-Pacific, and the US needs to attract greater support for its strategy toward the region and China,” he said.\nChina’s economic mastermind Liu He steps out onto centre-stage at Davos\nTrump’s speech was a thoughtful retort to Chinese President Xi Jinping’s speech of a year ago, Kennedy added.\n“[Trump] argued that a prosperous American economy is important to global prosperity and that intensive government market interventions and industrial policy is a danger to the global economy,” Kennedy said.\n\nLast year at Davos, Xi made a keynote speech championing free trade and globalisation, and underscoring Beijing’s desire for a world leadership role. This year, Xi’s right-hand man and chief economic adviser Liu He reiterated that China stood firm against protectionism and pledged to continue to drive global development with sustainable growth.\nLiu also vowed that China would introduce economic reforms this year that “exceed the expectations of the international community”, without elaborating.\nYou are signed up.

Mark Zuckerberg believes it can be used to improve Facebook.\nBitcoin, however, is yet to convince everyone thanks largely to its lack of stability.

It’s gone well at times and quite poorly. It could fail completely and go to zero, but it has accomplished a number of things I think are remarkable.”\nRimer, though, conceded that bitcoin is still mainly popular amongst “hobbyists”, and that it might be too volatile to ever become truly mainstream.\nHowever, regulation could change that, he added.\n“I do think [bitcoin] needs to be regulated, just like anything I would want to become mainstream should be regulated,” he said.\nEarlier this week, the South Korean government announced that, from 30 January, everyone trading digital currencies in the country will have do so using their real names.\nShortly after, Theresa May said she will look at bitcoin and other digital currencies “very seriously”, as she’s concerned about their popularity amongst criminals.\nWe’ve teamed up with cryptocurrency trading platform eToro.

{"title": "How Mnuchin's words in Davos could send the US dollar spiralling", "author": "South China Morning Post", "pub_time": "2018年1月29日", "url": "http://www.scmp.com/business/banking-finance/article/2131132/how-mnuchins-words-davos-could-send-us-dollar-spiralling", "content": "\nThe Treasury Secretary hasn’t entirely disowned the strong US dollar mantra but his approach seems more nuanced. His problem is that markets don’t always do nuances\nComments:\n\nAt last week’s World Economic Forum (WEF) in Davos, no one made US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin refer to the benefits to the United States accruing from a weaker dollar. He chose to. Mnuchin may have added to the greenback’s existing woes by casting doubt over the Treasury’s long-standing adherence to a strong dollar policy.\n“Obviously a weaker dollar is good for us as it relates to trade and opportunities,” Mnuchin said on Wednesday. Although his comments overall were even-handed and he shouldn’t be accused of directly trying to talk the greenback down, Mnuchin doesn’t seem to be on the same page as many of his predecessors.\nAs he said on a WEF panel on Thursday, presumably as part of an attempt to persuade markets that the importance of one comment on Wednesday had been overblown, Mnuchin nevertheless noted that his position “is perhaps slightly different from previous Treasury secretaries” who have argued for a strong US dollar. Mnuchin backs free and floating currencies.\nThat said, on Friday he told CNBC a strong “long-term dollar” is in US interests.\nBut by deviating, however subtly, from the straightforward strong US dollar mantra, Mnuchin has effectively let the currency market think it knows both that he himself has no issue with a weaker greenback in the short term and that the US government, which doesn’t like intervention by others in the currency market, would be a bystander to such a move.\n“Ultimately, I want to see a strong dollar,” President Trump said on Thursday, arguably as part of a damage limitation exercise, but markets cannot have failed to notice his use of the word “ultimately.”\nTrump may have decided to comment because if overseas investors perceive the US Treasury is institutionally calm about another fall in the greenback’s value, they could start to demand higher yields to compensate them for holding the depreciating currency just when the US government’s borrowing needs are on the rise following the passage of taxation reform in December.\nIn 1971 President Nixon triggered a devaluation of the US dollar by unilaterally cancelling its international convertibility to gold. US Treasury Secretary John Connally famously told his G-10 colleagues that the “dollar is our currency but it’s your problem.”\nBut by 1978 the falling value of the dollar was very much the US’ problem. President Carter’s administration issued Carter Bonds – US Treasury bonds denominated in West German Deutschmarks and Swiss francs – in part to shore up the value of a plummeting US dollar.\nThe greenback only truly recovered with the much tighter monetary policy adopted by Paul Volcker at the Federal Reserve after August 1979. By 1985, the greenback had risen so high that six nations agreed the Plaza Accord in September of that year to drive it down. Yet less than two years later the same six countries signed the Louvre Accord to try to halt the greenback’s post-Plaza fall.\nFast forward to President Clinton’s first term and in 1993 Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen had no qualms about calling for a lower dollar/yen exchange rate as a way of addressing the rising US trade deficit with Japan. But with Bentsen succeeded as Treasury Secretary by Robert Rubin in January 1995, the strong dollar policy was born.\nWhile not directly attributable to Bentsen’s use of the dollar to strong-arm Japan, US Treasury yields soared in 1994 as their prices fell. Rubin’s adoption of the strong dollar policy helped arrest its decline while in the process giving comfort to overseas investors who, with fears about a falling greenback somewhat assuaged, felt happier returning to the market to buy Treasuries to fund Uncle Sam.\nAdditionally a rising greenback reduces the risk of higher inflation through the import channel even though it makes American exporters less competitive.\nIn truth, Robert Rubin and his successor Larry Summers calibrated a strong dollar mantra where the rhetoric satisfied market participants that was the US Treasury’s official stance even if the greenback was trading on the soft side in the real world. The Treasury could have a policy of benign neglect towards the greenback but with markets still believing a strong US dollar policy was in place.\nMnuchin hasn’t disowned the strong US dollar mantra in its entirety but his approach to the greenback seems more nuanced. His problem is that markets don’t always do nuances. As a consequence of a few words uttered in the Swiss Alps last week the US dollar could begin a new downhill slide.\nYou are signed up.

Liu, who is widely seen as the mastermind behind Xi’s supply-side structural reform concept, was promoted to the 25-member Politburo at the 19th party congress in October.\nWhere will Liu He, the mastermind of China’s economic policies, go next?\nXi made a surprise appearance at Davos last year, singing the praises of free trade and globalisation. US President Donald Trump will follow in his footsteps at next week’s gathering, though his message – promoting the “America first” policy – will be quite different.\nFrench president Emmanuel Macron is also expected to attend, and German Chancellor Angela Merkel may also join the annual four-day summit of political and business elites, which begins on January 23.\n\nWhile Liu is not a direct counterpart of Trump, Macron or Merkel, the Harvard-educated Chinese official is a key decision maker on China’s economic and financial policies.\nLiao Qun, chief economist at China Citic Bank International, said the decision showed Liu was now among the high-ranking officials in Beijing.\n“He’s become a member of the Politburo and will be expected to oversee China’s finance and economic policies [at the National People’s Congress] in March,” Liao said. “Davos is focused on the economy, so Liu is an appropriate choice to head the delegation, even if he’s not the president. But he’s an expert [on the economy] and a high-ranking official who has a close relationship with Xi.”\nChinese leaders have in previous years used the Davos forum to send a policy message to the international community. Former premier Wen Jiabao talked up Beijing’s huge stimulus plan to counter the global financial crisis in 2009, while Premier Li Keqiang tried to ease concerns about China’s economic slowdown with a speech on the “new normal” growth that is slower and more sustainable in 2015. Two years ago, Vice-President Li Yuanchao used his appearance at Davos to defend the yuan.\nHow Liu He went from government researcher to Xi’s right-hand man\nBut this practice reached its zenith last year when Xi took centre-stage at the event, becoming the first Chinese president to attend the forum as he presented the country as a champion of globalisation.\n“A trade war will only lead to suffering on both sides,” Xi told thousands of business and political leaders at the Swiss ski resort. “Those who push for protectionism are shutting themselves inside a dark house. They have escaped the rain and clouds outside, but also missed the light and air.”\nXi’s speech was widely read as a criticism of Trump and a symbol of China’s growing influence on the world stage as the US is taking a step back from global leadership.\nTrump will be the first US president to attend the summit of the world’s rich and powerful in almost two decades – the last US leader seen at this gathering was Bill Clinton in 2000.\nAdditional reporting by Sidney Leng\nYou are signed up.

Namely, that the world’s second-largest economy would push ahead with its supply-side reforms, pursue high-quality rather than high-speed growth, and would make curbing financial risk, alleviating poverty and preventing pollution its top priorities.\nChina should ‘be ready for a trade war’ after Donald Trump’s Davos speech\nFor Mats Harborn, president of the European Union Chamber of Commerce in China, Liu’s speech lacked commitment.\n“While the European chamber recognises that some important initiatives have taken place in the last year, the direct impact on most foreign businesses has been limited,” he said.\n“There is a frustrating gap between promises and action. A clear implementation timeline is now required.”\nIn his speech, Liu repeated an early promise made by Xi that China would further open up its financial markets, and said the government would enhance intellectual property protection, and ease the investment restrictions on foreign firms in the manufacturing and services sectors.\nChina’s new growth model will ‘create opportunities’ for foreign firms\nSteve Tsang, director of the SOAS China Institute at the University of London, said that despite Liu’s promises, it would be unwise for the global business community to think that anyone other than Xi was steering the ship when it came to China’s economic direction.\n“Liu was hand-picked by Xi and it would make good sense to use his expertise in economic policy and the positive image he has to take charge of and deliver the economic reform package. But it will be naive to expect that it means Liu can proceed as he sees fit,” he said.\n“Xi … clearly intends to leave his mark on the Communist Party and on China, so it is reasonable to expect that he will want to push for the changes he wants now that he has consolidated power. Liu’s speech confirms such an intention.”\nHow Liu He went from government researcher to Xi’s right-hand man\nSince Liu was elevated to the 25-member Politburo at the 19th party congress in October, he has been widely expected to take a front-row seat in helping to steer the Chinese economy.\n“[But] He will work closely with Xi and will only deliver a programme that Xi agrees to and approves of,” Tsang said.\n“The Davos rhetoric should not be seen as anything more [or less] than that. It is what Xi and Liu would like the top corporate world to hear. The Chinese government will implement policies that the [Communist] party judges as being good for China and the party, not what will be good for the Davos crowd. Nor will they see anything Liu said at Davos as tying the hands of the Chinese government,” he said.\nChinese leaders identify top three economic battles: risk, poverty and pollution\nAndrew Collier, managing director of Orient Capital Research in Shanghai, took a similar view. While acknowledging Liu’s personal credentials, he said he was unlikely to find it easy to push through any reforms or changes that were not already on the party’s agenda.\n“Liu He is widely respected globally and has a reputation as a reformer. His short stint at Harvard has given him a taste of Western academic training, plus he has many contacts outside China,” he said.\n“However, despite the leadership’s commitment to reform, there has been little evidence of progress. This is due to a combination of an overly centralised political structure at the top and difficult financial issues among local governments at the bottom. Liu is going to have a tough time tackling the reforms he is hoping to achieve.”\nMore targeted reform and innovation key to China’s economic renewal, Chinese Premier Li Keqiang says\nZhu Haibin, an economist with JP Morgan Chase, said he found it interesting that Liu was upbeat in his assessment of the global economic outlook for 2018.\n“In previous years, when Xi or Premier Li Keqiang talked about the global economy their tone was balanced, but this time [it] was much more positive,” he said.\n“The possible implication is that that might allow more room for domestic reforms.”\nHenry Chan Hing Lee, an adjunct research fellow at the National University of Singapore’s East Asia Institute, said it was also noteworthy that Liu said China would bring its overall leverage ratio under effective control in three years.\n“The issue of over-leverage is often cited, both by the government and overseas observers, as the key danger to the Chinese economy,” he said.\nAdditional reporting by Sidney Leng\nYou are signed up.

Et comment comprendre la réplique de Washington prêt à taxer de son côté plusieurs centaines de biens de consommation Made in China ?\nLors d’un entretien avec Henry Kissinger en avril 2013, le tout nouveau président Xi Jinping affirmait pourtant que « l'établissement d'un nouveau type de relations entre les puissances que sont la Chine et les États-Unis nécessite une accumulation de concessions mutuelles ».\nOr, depuis l'avènement de Trump à la Maison Blanche la rivalité commerciale entre les États-Unis et la Chine structure désormais la politique étrangère et stratégique de ces pays. Un sérieux objet d’inquiétudes de part et d’autre du Pacifique.\nRead more: La nouvelle Route de la Soie, une stratégie d’influence mondiale de la Chine\nLa balance commerciale entre la Chine et les États-Unis continue de se creuser. En 2017, l’excédent commercial chinois s’élève (selon les douanes chinoises) à 375,2  milliards de dollars.\nOr cet excédent continue de progresser (environ 20 % au premier trimestre par rapport au début de l’année 2017), du fait des imposantes capacités commerciales chinoises.\nPékin est aussi le plus gros créancier de Washington avec environ 1200 milliards de dollars de bons du Trésor.\nDébut avril, Trump martelait que le gouvernement de Xi était « le plus grand manipulateur de devises de tout les temps », et devrait être donc puni. Quelques jours auparavant, lors d’une rencontre de haut niveau avec une délégation du Congrès américain, le Premier Ministre Li Keqiang avertissait que la Chine était «  parfaitement préparée à des contre-mesures, à des ripostes  » face à l'agressivité américaine.\nLa crise entre Washington et Pékin témoigne d’une lutte pour le leadership entre les deux grandes puissances : d’un côté, les États-Unis durcissent le ton et renforcent leur système de protection face une puissance en plein expansion.\nDe l’autre, la Chine dissipe l’idée d’une « menace chinoise  » et répond indirectement aux tensions.\nCette situation tendue intervient au moment où la Chine tente de moderniser ses infrastructures financières en misant notamment sur les nouvelles technologies et ainsi de gagner en puissance et en stabilité.\nUne perspective que Trump essaye d’enrayer.\nLes sanctions américaines sur les produits chinois ont été au coeur de la campagne de Donald Trump, malgré les nombreuses critiques soulignant que ce protectionnisme à outrance servirait avant tout les intérêts du Parti-État chinois.\nEn 2018 pourtant, dès le 22 janvier, à la veille du Forum de Davos, Trump persiste et annonce une série de sanctions tarifaires et de taxes contre sur les panneaux solaires, les machines à laver ainsi que sur des métaux comme l’aluminium et l’acier, inquiétant un moment les intérêts européens et japonais.\nComme prévu, Pékin a répliqué courant mars en publiant une liste de 128 produits américains qui seraient taxés de 15 à 25 % en cas d’échec de négociations commerciales avec Washington, représentant une perte potentielle de 3 milliards de dollars pour l'état américain. Il s'agit essentiellement de produits agro-alimentaires, tubes d’acier et produits d’aluminium recyclés.\nLe 22 mars les États-Unis publient une liste de 1300 produits chinois (d'un montant totalisant environ 50 milliards de dollars) pouvant être taxés à l'importation jusqu'à à 25 %..\nLes fleurons industriels chinois tels que Huawei ou ZTE, grands concurrents des leaders américains sont particulièrement ciblés.\nTrump menace également la Chine de 100 milliards de dollars de taxes supplémentaires en application de l'article 301 (notamment sur la propriété intellectuelle).\nLes avancées technologiques, notamment le programme chinois « Made in China 2025 » de modernisation de l'ensemble appareil industriel sont aussi dans le viseur du président américain.\nCe programme a été lancé en 2015 et promu par Li Keqiang. Une [dizaine de secteurs clés de l’industrie sont concernées. « Made in China 2025 » entend fabriquer « maison » des machines-outils, des équipements agricoles, transports, nouveaux matériaux de pointe destinés aussi bien à la construction navale qu'à l’aéronautique.\nLe gouvernement chinois investit largement (des subventions, des prêts et des obligations) pour soutenir les entreprises nationales de haute technologie et les encourager à s'étendre à l'étranger.\nCette stratégie industrielle sur 10 ans se déploie par ailleurs dans des villes modernisées (Chengdu, Ningbo, Guangzhou, Wuhan etc.). Elle vise à tisser des partenariats et des coopérations avec l’étranger, pour changer son image de pays-pilleur de propriété intellectuelle et de technologies.\nOr les nouvelles règles chinoises exigent des entreprises étrangères un transfert de technologies systématique en échange de l’accès au marché chinois, dans l'optique de développer l'industrie nationale.\nCôté américain, Steven Mnuchin, ex-Goldman Sachs, actuel secrétaire au Trésor, soutien de Donald Trump et principal négociateur avec Pékin, temporise pourtant en déclarant que s'il y avait « [des possibilités de guerre commerciale avec la Chine, …) ce n’était pas l’objectif ».\nLes risques d’une escalade seraient en effets trop importants pour ces deux économies si dépendantes l'une de l'autre. Les grandes entreprises américaines ont bien trop besoin de l’assemblage et de la fabrication chinoise. Ce marché représente ainsi environ 20 % du chiffre d’affaires d’Apple, 13 % du chiffre d’affaires de Boeing, 65 % pour Qualcomm ou encore 44 % pour Texas Instrument.\nL'autre atout de la Chine face aux États-Unis se situe sur une île.\nHainan (34,000 km², 10 millions d'habitants) anciennement rattachée à la province du Guangdong a été transformée il y a 30 ans en une vaste zone franche (zone économique spéciale). Elle est aujourd’hui au coeur de la nouvelle dynamique économique, financière et stratégique de Pékin.\nLe forum de Bo’ao, le « Davos chinois », à peine achevé (mi avril) a ainsi réitéré le besoin de faire de l’île une nouvelle zone d’investissement à destination des pays de l’Asie Pacifique dans le prolongement de l'ambitieuse route de la Soie, à l’intermédiaire entre Hong Kong et Singapour.\nFort d'un secteur des services modernisé, dont le chiffres d'affaire s'élève à 71 milliards de dollars en 2017, l'île va bénéficier d'investissements importants dans le secteur portuaire, immobilier et touristique (59 pays seront exemptés de visa).\nHainan se veut être une Hawaii asiatique en misant sur ses paysages, ses plages de sables et une ouverture sur la mer de Chine du méridionale.\nLa modernisation de l'île, son internationalisation et sa position stratégique montre ainsi que Pékin s’approprie le concept « indopacifique  » plutôt américain et prend pied dans une zone courtisée par les quatre grandes démocraties de l’architecture régionale du « Quad » (Quadrilateral Defence Coordination Group) (Japon, Inde, Australie et États-Unis).\nCe groupe - qui vise à une coordination des efforts de sécurité dans la zone- tente par ailleurs de limiter la montée en puissance de la Chine en Asie-Pacifique.\nMais les tentatives semblent frêles et vaines face par exemple au récent déploiement de l’armada chinoise (48 navires) en mer de Chine du Sud, zone hautement contestée à l'international et en particulier par les États-Unis.\nRead more: Why is the South China Sea so important to the US?\nPar ailleurs, Xi Jinping continue de titiller Trump.

The facilities, one of which could well be in Hainan, would have greater autonomy, more economic freedom and provide easier access to China’s markets for foreign companies, according to earlier reports.\nThe tit-for-tat trade dispute between China and the US is showing no signs of stopping. On Thursday, Washington threatened to impose hefty tariffs on a further US$50 billion worth of goods it imports from China, while Beijing hit back by saying it would protect its interests “at any cost”.\nIn a tweet on Monday, US President Donald Trump described its trading relationship with China as “stupid”.\n“When a car is sent to the United States from China, there is a Tariff to be paid of 2 1/2%. When a car is sent to China from the United States, there is a Tariff to be paid of 25%. Does that sound like free or fair trade. No, it sounds like STUPID TRADE – going on for years!”\nWhen a car is sent to the United States from China, there is a Tariff to be paid of 2 1/2%. When a car is sent to China from the United States, there is a Tariff to be paid of 25%. Does that sound like free or fair trade. No, it sounds like STUPID TRADE - going on for years!\n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 9, 2018\nZhou Wenzhong, general secretary of the Boao Forum said that at a time when globalisation was facing great challenges, the event provided an opportunity for academics, businesspeople and politicians to exchange opinions and expertise.\n“We hope those taking part will take back the consensus [reached] to their countries, and [use it to] influence their governments and policies,” he said.\nUS and China must step back from brink of trade war, says Dutch Prime Minister\nChina’s leaders were keen to promote the nation’s free-trade agenda even before the conference got under way.\nOn Sunday, China’s Foreign Minister Wang Yi met his Singaporean counterpart, Vivian Balakrishnan, in Beijing. The two men committed to increasing cooperation in the fight against protectionism and maintaining the global trading system with the World Trade Organisation at its core.\nMeanwhile, China’s Vice-President Wang Qishan told Singapore’s Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong that the two countries were “old friends” and that cooperation between them had a “strategic value”.\nLin Guijun, vice-president of the University of International Business and Economics in Beijing, said the Boao Forum would provide an opportunity for Beijing to send a message to the world amid the backdrop of rising protectionism.\n“China should make clear its position and make a contribution to global growth,” he said.\n\nChina should look beyond US Treasuries for ‘real assets’, central bank adviser says\nBut Christopher Balding, an associate professor of business and economics at the HSBC Business School in the south China city of Shenzhen, was less optimistic, saying that previous events showed that while many things were discussed in Hainan, few concrete changes ever came out of it.\n“Basically everything China does every year gets a little more attention, and because of all the trade tension this year it is getting even more attention,” he said.\n“[Xi] wants to say that China is very open, ready for investments, but at the same time he is basically going to say that we are not going to change anything or do anything different for the US. If you look at a lot of these speeches over time they are pretty much the same.”\nThough even that might be enough for Beijing to win some support, he said.\n“It won’t surprise anyone if [people leave] saying that China is more open, but that is clearly just the effect of the propaganda.”\nYou are signed up.

{"title": "Post-Davos depression", "author": "EJ Insight", "pub_time": "2018年2月1日", "url": "http://www.ejinsight.com/20180202-post-davos-depression/", "content": "I’ve been attending the World Economic Forum’s annual conference in Davos, Switzerland – where the so-called global elite convenes to discuss the world’s problems – since 1995. Never have I come away more dispirited than I have this year.\nThe world is plagued by almost intractable problems. Inequality is surging, especially in the advanced economies. The digital revolution, despite its potential, also carries serious risks for privacy, security, jobs, and democracy – challenges that are compounded by the rising monopoly power of a few American and Chinese data giants, including Facebook and Google. Climate change amounts to an existential threat to the entire global economy as we know it.\nPerhaps more disheartening than such problems, however, are the responses. To be sure, here at Davos, CEOs from around the world begin most of their speeches by affirming the importance of values. Their activities, they proclaim, are aimed not just at maximizing profits for shareholders, but also at creating a better future for their workers, the communities in which they work, and the world more generally. They may even pay lip service to the risks posed by climate change and inequality.\nBut, by the end of their speeches this year, any remaining illusion about the values motivating Davos CEOs was shattered. The risk that these CEOs seemed most concerned about is the populist backlash against the kind of globalization that they have shaped – and from which they have benefited immensely.\nNot surprisingly, these economic elites barely grasp the extent to which this system has failed large swaths of the population in Europe and the United States, leaving most households’ real incomes stagnant and causing labor’s share of income to decline substantially. In the US, life expectancy has declined for the second year in a row; among those with only a high school education, the decline has been underway for much longer.\nNot one of the US CEOs whose speech I heard (or heard about) mentioned the bigotry, misogyny, or racism of US President Donald Trump, who was present at the event. Not one mentioned the relentless stream of ignorant statements, outright lies, and impetuous actions that have eroded the standing of the US president – and thus of the US – in the world. None mentioned the abandonment of systems for ascertaining truth, and of truth itself.\nIndeed, none of America’s corporate titans mentioned the administration’s reductions in funding for science, so important for strengthening the US economy’s comparative advantage and supporting gains in Americans’ standard of living. None mentioned the Trump administration’s rejection of international institutions, either, or the attacks on the domestic media and judiciary – which amounts to an assault on the system of checks and balances that underpins US democracy.\nNo, the CEOs at Davos were licking their lips at the tax legislation that Trump and congressional Republicans recently pushed through, which will deliver hundreds of billions of dollars to large corporations and the wealthy people who own and run them – people like Trump himself. They are unperturbed by the fact that the same legislation will, when it is fully implemented, lead to an increase in taxes for the majority of the middle class – a group whose fortunes have been in decline for the last 30 years or so.\nEven in their narrowly materialistic world, where growth matters above all else, the Trump tax legislation should not be celebrated. After all, it lowers taxes on real-estate speculation – an activity that has produced sustainable prosperity nowhere, but has contributed to rising inequality everywhere.\nThe legislation also imposes a tax on universities like Harvard and Princeton – sources of numerous important ideas and innovations – and will lead to lower local-level public expenditure in parts of the country that have thrived, precisely because they have made public investments in education and infrastructure. The Trump administration is clearly willing to ignore the obvious fact that, in the twenty-first century, success actually demands more investment in education.\nFor the CEOs of Davos, it seems that tax cuts for the rich and their corporations, along with deregulation, is the answer to every country’s problems. Trickle-down economics, they claim, will ensure that, ultimately, the entire population benefits economically. And the CEOs’ good hearts are apparently all that is needed to ensure that the environment is protected, even without relevant regulations.\nYet the lessons of history are clear. Trickle-down economics doesn’t work. And one of the key reasons why our environment is in such a precarious condition is that corporations have not, on their own, lived up to their social responsibilities. Without effective regulations and a real price to pay for polluting, there is no reason whatsoever to believe that they will behave differently than they have.\nThe Davos CEOs were euphoric about the return to growth, about their soaring profits and compensation. Economists reminded them that this growth is not sustainable, and has never been inclusive. But such arguments have little impact in a world where materialism is king.\nSo forget the platitudes about values that CEOs recite in the opening paragraphs of their speeches. They may lack the candor of Michael Douglas’s character in the 1987 movie Wall Street, but the message hasn’t changed: “Greed is good.” What depresses me is that, though the message is obviously false, so many in power believe it to be true.\nCopyright: Project Syndicate\n– Contact us at [email protected]\nRC\n\n"}

There are literally dozens of panels on the topic scattered around this snow-buried village, as my colleague Adam Lashinsky reported yesterday. There seems to be no-one here who questions the notion that vast amounts of data combined with powerful machine-learning algorithms will not only transform almost every business, but also the way we live.\nBut while the promise of AI is widely accepted, the practice remains fairly limited. Martin Reeves of BCG reported that his firm, working with MIT, surveyed more than 3,000 companies last year and found that while 85% of them believed AI would become a competitive advantage in the future, only a quarter were implementing it now, and only 5% were implementing it extensively. On the same panel, Renault-Nissan CEO Carlos Ghosn said adapting products to the unprecedented pace of innovation has become the top job of every CEO.\nAt a separate event, investor and former Google executive Kai Fu Lee confirmed what we reported from Guangzhou last December—that China may soon pass the U.S. in developing AI technology. He cited four reasons:\nLater today, I’ll be moderating a panel on rising trade tensions that will include Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, WTO head Roberto Acevedo, Cargill CEO David MacLennan, Standard Charter CEO Bill Winter, and Eni Chairman Emma Marcegaglia. The session, certain to produce some fireworks, will be webcast on Fortune.com.\nMore news below.\nHuge Qualcomm Fine\nThe European Commission has hit chip firm Qualcomm with a $1.23 billion antitrust fine for illegally paying Apple billions to make sure that only Qualcomm’s LTE baseband processors were used in iPhones and iPads between 2011 and 2016. The fine represents 4.9% of Qualcomm’s 2017 turnover. The main victim of the secret arrangement was Intel. Fortune\nToys “R” Us Slims Down\nToys “R” Us will shut down around a fifth of its U.S. stores as it tries to claw its way out of bankruptcy. The closure of around 180 stores will begin in early February. The bricks-and-mortar retail chain is, like many others, struggling as online sales gain in popularity. Fortune\nWhite House Sour on Immigration Deal\nThe White House considers the bipartisan Senate proposal for fixing immigration—a bill that would legalize so-called “Dreamers”—to be “totally unacceptable,” it said Tuesday. “To my friends at the White House, you’ve been all over the board, you haven’t been a reliable partner and the Senate is going to move,” said Senator Lindsey Graham. Wall Street Journal\nSenate Approves Powell\nThe U.S. Senate has confirmed Jerome Powell as the next chair of the Federal Reserve, by a whopping 84 votes to 13. Powell, currently a governor of the central bank, is a lawyer rather than an economist by training, and he will need to figure out how to deal with the Trump administrations deregulatory push. Fortune\nGlobal Debt Threat\nYesterday’s CEO Daily highlighted current economic optimism, but J.P. Morgan’s international chairman, Jacob Frenkel, has warned business and political leaders not to forget the problem of excessive global debt, which he said was the most pressing concern for the global economy. CNBC\nOil Peak Looms\nGlobal demand for oil may peak in a decade’s time, according to internal Shell studies. The scenario has led the company to shift its strategy so that it doesn’t end up holding too many fossil fuel extraction assets when the world has moved on to renewables. Fortune\nWomen in Politics\nJust under 20% of the House of Representatives are women, and the Senate isn’t much better. That means the U.S. is ranked 99th globally when it comes to female legislators—below Saudi Arabia, let alone other Western countries. At least the U.S. beats Kyrgyzstan. Fortune\nMen-Only Fundraiser Exposed\nThe U.K.’s FT sent an undercover reporter to the President’s Club Charity Dinner, a longstanding, men-only London charitable fundraiser that auctions off things like lunch with foreign secretary Boris Johnson.

This year’s theme is “Creating a Shared Future in a Fractured World”.\nYou are signed up. We think you'd also like\n"}

Others have detailed proposals such as a “Human Development Index”, and a new addition to the literature has been published this week from Financial Times journalist David Pilling, entitled The Growth Delusion.\nIn Davos, Coyle outlined new thinking that would supplement brute economic data with measurements covering human capital (skills and education), physical infrastructure and “intangible capital” such as computerised data and patents. They would also cover environmental quality, and “social capital” looking at how united or divided a country is.\nAscribing a value to data is particularly pressing as companies and customers increasingly transact their lives “in the cloud”. To take one example, a globally accessible and hugely useful resource like Wikipedia is worth precisely zero in traditional GDP accounting models.\nNeither does GDP encompass the black market, omitting a huge source of activity and income in many developing countries, including Africa and Latin America.\nNotably, GDP cannot measure the distribution of wealth within a country. So while its total value can go up, gains are all too often skewed towards top earners. Those lower down the ladder can fall further behind in relative terms.\nThat is exactly what has been playing out in the United States, powering a populist backlash that elected Donald Trump, and influencing the British people’s decision to quit the European Union.\nAfter the Brexit referendum campaign, pro-EU campaigner Anand Menon wrote he was trying to explain at one event about the hit to GDP he felt would come if Britons voted to leave the bloc.\nChina’s leaders are too obsessed with the GDP growth rate, says S&P chief economist\nHe said one woman in the audience in Newcastle, northern England, shouted back “that’s your bloody GDP, not ours”.\nDeveloped in 1934 by economist Simon Kuznets to help the United States chart an escape from the Great Depression, GDP measures the total value of a country’s goods and services over quarters and years.\nWoe betide a government that heads into an election on the back of a recession – usually defined as two consecutive quarters of decline in its GDP.\nBut even where there is growth, disenchantment with how it is shared out can be seen vividly in Brexit-bound Britain, according to Inga Beale, chief executive of Lloyd’s of London, the insurance market.\n\n“We’ve got to find another mechanism to include much bigger parts of the population, and use different metrics to measure success of a country,” she told CNBC television.\nGDP is widely seen as a blunt instrument to measure growth, and has attracted criticism from Nobel Prize winners Joseph Stiglitz and Amartya Sen, and International Monetary Fund chief Christine Lagarde, among others.\nBut countries that do execute sustained rises in GDP can use the accreted wealth to transform their standing.\nExhibit A is China, which after decades of pell-mell growth is now the world’s second-biggest economy as measured by GDP, awarding it the kind of international prestige and influence it has not enjoyed for centuries.\nBut even in China the GDP debate is intensifying as President Xi Jinping attempts to prioritise quality over quantity in the economy’s expansion.\nSo what are the alternatives to GDP?\nDissident thinkers are calling for a holistic approach that calibrates not just economic inputs but human capital along with quality-of-life issues.\nWith the planet warming and some resources already exploited to near exhaustion, including many fisheries, the WEF proposed a broader measure of growth called the Inclusive Development Index that accounts for such factors.\nThe 2018 index assessed 103 economies by measuring three individual pillars – growth and development, inclusion, and intergenerational equity. On that basis, Norway is the world’s richest country and the rest of the top 10 comprises small European countries and Australia. Germany is in 12th position, the United States is 23rd and China 26th.\n“Decades of prioritising economic growth over social equity has led to historically high levels of wealth and income inequality,” the WEF said in a report. “[That’s] caused governments to miss out on a virtuous circle in which growth is strengthened by being shared more widely and generated without unduly straining the environment or burdening future generations.”\n\nThe WEF report showed that while advanced economies grew GDP by 5.3 per cent, on average, between 2012 and 2016, inclusion grew only by 0.01 per cent.\n“Under-emphasis of these [structural] policies relative to macroeconomic, trade and financial stability policies is a key reason for many governments’ failure in recent decades to mobilise a more effective response to widening inequality and stagnating median income as technological change and globalisation have gathered force,” the report said.\nOverall, the findings largely make for bleak reading. Over the past five years, despite a growing world economy, social inclusion has fallen or been unchanged in 20 of 29 advanced economies and intergenerational equity has worsened in 56 of 74 emerging economies, according to the report.\nChina’s new economy grows twice as fast as GDP and helps offset job losses, says top think tank\nOver the same period, less than half of the advanced economies were successful in reducing poverty and only eight recorded a decrease in income inequality.\nWEF argued that using GDP as a primary economic metric is ineffective as it measures current production of goods and services rather than the extent to which the economy contributes to broader socio-economic progress as seen in median household income, employment opportunity, economic security and quality of life.\nIn any case, Professor Coyle said, countries do not drastically have to overhaul their national accounting to take stock of environmental degradation caused by the rush for growth.\n“You just need to breathe the air in Beijing to feel the cost,” she said.\nAdditional reporting by Bloomberg\nYou are signed up.

As for economic activity, 13.51 million new jobs were created in 2017, maintaining the record of more than 13 million for five consecutive years. The number of newly registered enterprises amounted to 6.07 million, up by 9.9%. Regarding economic structure, the dominance of the services industry became more prominent. The proportion of tertiary industry in GDP was 51.6% – 11.1 percentage points higher than that of secondary industry. The services industry contributed 58.8% to economic growth, an increase of 1.3 percentage points over the previous year. Consumption continued to be the driving force behind economic growth, totalling 58.8% – 26.7 percentage points higher than the gross capital formation.\nRegarding economic quality, energy consumption per RMB10,000 GDP dropped by 3.7% compared with 2016; and the author believes that most people will have personal experience of environmental improvement and more effective pollution control. The increase in residential consumption is apparent: the Engel coefficient was 29.3%, down 0.8 percentage points over the previous year. Per capita expenditure in 2017 was 11% on healthcare and 8.9% on education, culture and entertainment. With the further concentration on the ethos of ‘manufacturing, service plus internet’ and accelerated online and offline integration, high-end consumption began spreading further into middle-income groups.\nIn conclusion, the macroeconomy grew steadily in 2017, manifesting generally benign changes. Supply-side structural reform is gradually taking effect. Since the 18th National Congress of the Communist Party of China (CPC) in 2012, a roll-out of crucial reform measures has improved the efficiency of resource allocation, total factor productivity and advanced macroeconomic development. For instance, there was strong support for reforms prioritising the household registration system; the policy encouraging rural migrant populations to relocate to cities was fully implemented nationwide2; endowment and medical insurance were enacted in urban and rural areas3; and a unified fund was established to ensure resources for compulsory education in all regions.4\nChina also pushed ahead with market-based reform in the exchange and use of land: rural collective construction land will now, like urban land, enter the market under new land-use regulation5; rural rights on ownership, contract and management have been separated and the exchange of land has been enabled6; and agricultural product price reform7 has optimised the allocation of land use.\nChina has accelerated the pace of ‘opening‑up’ to the outside world by introducing a management model of pre-establishment national treatment with a negative list, in accordance with the principle that such a model can be copied and with the expectation that the model can be applied to other areas. It has also implemented a high-level trade and investment liberalisation facilitation policy to reduce import tariffs and cut trade barriers. China’s business reform focused on removing inappropriate administrative controls and drastically lowering the threshold for access to the free market. Meanwhile, China has implemented judicial reform: the Supreme Court set up six circuit courts to achieve full coverage and carry out more contracts; and trials in cross-regional civil litigation cases have been made fairer. In addition, China has set up intellectual property courts in Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou to strengthen the protection of property rights. All of these measures have markedly improved the business environment in China – it now ranks 78th out of 190 economies, 18 places higher than in 2013.8\nNo target for GDP growth was proposed at the 19th CPC National Congress, but China must continue to maintain an appropriate economic growth rate to turn the ‘two-step’ blueprint for development – China realising socialist modernisation by 2035, and becoming a modern, prosperous nation by the middle of the century – into a reality. Realism is required to maintain economic growth within the correct parameters and achieve high-quality development. China’s macro policy must focus on supply-side structural reform as there is only limited policy scope for implementing demand management in the coming period.\n1. Fiscal and monetary aggregate policies are limited. On the part of fiscal policy, there is little scope for large-scale, concentrated infrastructure development after so many previous rounds of stimulation. On the one hand, the local debt risks proliferate, and infrastructure debt should not be increased further. On the other, it is quite reasonable to carry out infrastructure development such as transportation in accordance with the principle of advancement. A balance should be struck: with the development of a metropolitan-centred urban belt and a people-oriented urbanisation process, ample and sustained latitude exists for economically viable investment in infrastructure.\nIn terms of monetary policy, China’s monetary multiplier has risen rapidly, from 3.86 in 2012 to 5.02 in 2016, while the ratio of M2 to GDP has increased from 180.3% to 208.3% over the same period,9 indicating rapid economic monetisation. The GDP growth rate has, however, been declining simultaneously, indicating that the expansion of the money supply is impacting less on the economy. To this end, stimulus through monetary policy will only aggravate over-monetisation and further amplify the shift from a real to a virtual economy while playing a limited role in stimulating economic growth.\n2. Greater latitude is needed for fiscal policy to focus on structural adjustment in line with supply-side structural reform. Tax relief can help enterprises increase investment in research and development (R&D), as well as enhance economic vitality through innovation. Efforts can be made to cut overcapacity in expenditure, reduce excess inventory, deleverage, lower costs and strengthen areas of weakness through readjustment of expenditure. Resources can also be guided to industries more in line with macro-control measures to improve the diversity and quality of supply. Fiscal policy has much to offer in these areas. Monetary policy, in principle, has all the attributes required without the need to adjust the structure. Against the backdrop of a ‘new normal’ in the economy, save for major external shocks or internal systemic risks, the adoption of monetary distortions similar to US monetary policy or European Central Bank structural policy instruments will be unnecessary. The European Union has a single currency, but no unified finance, so must adopt monetary policy tools to achieve structural adjustment.\n3. Supply-side structural reform should be problem-conscious and focused on long-term goals and dedicated effort. A report from the 19th CPC National Congress states that: “As China’s socialism with Chinese characteristics has entered a new era, the principal contradiction facing Chinese society has evolved. What China now faces is the contradiction between unbalanced and inadequate development and people’s ever-growing needs for a better life.” The report records the unwavering national reality that China is, and will in the long term remain, at the primary stage of socialism. Its international status as the largest developing country has not changed. Supply-side structural reform must, on the one hand, adapt to the change in social contradictions, be problem-aware and serve high-quality economic development; and, on the other hand, emphasise long-term goals and institution-building and continue to introduce reform measures to increase effectiveness year-on-year.\nChina’s economic development is still confronted by two deep-rooted contradictions. One is the reality that economic and social development cannot be advanced merely by will alone. The other is efficiency loss, caused by the distortion of institutional mechanisms, which can be corrected through reforms that aim to improve the efficiency of resource allocation and further boost economic growth.\nWith regard to objective reality, improvements can be made in advancing economic and social development with the aid of supply-side structural reform, but fundamental change is not possible. For example, China has experienced a decrease in its workforce since 2015, and this trend is accelerating. In 2017, the working population aged between 16 and 59 years was 902 million, a decrease of 5.48 million on the previous year. The population over the age of 60 years reached 241 million, an increase of 10 million on 2016, and accounts for 17.3% of the total population.10 The two-child policy, introduced in 2015, has helped increase the population and the supply of future labour, but the recent drop in labour force participation has become a risk factor and has made the future unpredictable.\nChina has stepped up efforts in environmental protection and pollution control to meet the public’s need for a better life. But there may be some trade-off, as development that caused increased pollution also resulted in GDP growth. In addition, the external environment is tumultuous – trade protectionism is on the rise. Supply-side structural reform must be concentrated on improving the identification of problems or making appropriate delays. China must, while boosting high-quality economic development, avoid major fluctuations and maintain growth.\nSupply-side structural reform must contend with the distortion of institutional mechanisms and prioritise the following\nfive aspects:\n1. Promoting the free flow of factors. The pace of urbanisation has accelerated; the reform of the household registration system has been comprehensively carried out; rural land transfer has been piloted; market-orientated allocation of land-use patterns has also made remarkable progress; some inefficient planting areas have been gradually withdrawn, and thus the agricultural production structure has been improved. The area allocated for the production of maize, with a high inventory in 2017, was reduced by 3.6%, while the allocated area for bean sowing was increased by 6.7%.12\nMany obstacles stand in the way of the free flow of factors. Labour mobility, restricting people’s ability to obtain cars and houses and enrol in higher education, through permanent resident permits, is still relatively common in some cities, which is not only a hindrance to the free movement of workers, but also to the improvement of income distribution as, according to the theory of development economics, the transfer of citizens living in agricultural regions to non-agricultural sectors improves income distribution. China’s Gini coefficient was 0.467 in 2017, having risen for two consecutive years. Although this magnitude is small, it highlights that, despite accelerated urbanisation, barriers to the free flow of population widens the gap in income distribution. Efforts must be made to remove all benefits attached to household registration, advancing ‘equal rights for tenants and homeowners’,11 providing both with access to basic public services and promoting the free movement of the labour force. This will help improve total factor productivity, advance income distribution and reduce labour costs.\n2. Streamlining administration and cutting taxes and administrative fees. Since the 18th CPC National Congress, strenuous efforts have been made towards reforming business, streamlining administration and delegating government powers. The next step is to reinforce institutional reform. In terms of tax cuts, annual revenue for 2017 was RMB17.3 trillion, an increase of 7.4%. This growth rate shows the effectiveness of tax cuts – if fiscal revenue is synchronised with a nominal GDP growth rate of 10.5% (6.9% plus 3.6% deflator), the fiscal revenue for the full year should be RMB17.8 trillion, and the RMB500 billion increase on actual income shows the effects of tax relief. Given better connectivity between fiscal income and the producer price index (PPI), estimated tax cuts would be even greater if calculated with 6.3% of PPI in 2016.12 This highlights the obvious effect of China’s tax reduction. In 2017, raw material prices rose by more than 8%, PPI by 6.3% and consumer price index by 1.6%, indicating that pressure is moving to the middle- and low-income groups. More taxes apply to high-income groups, but a limited adjustment to income distribution is effected. Further analysis reveals that there remains scope for additional tax cuts: the push for income tax reform, increasing deductions from corporate income tax in R&D, transferring personal income tax to comprehensive collection, reducing the tax burden on low-income groups, avoiding personal tax’s evolution into payroll tax, and forming reverse regulation. Additionally, administrative fee cuts and charges for non-administrative licensing projects lacking a statutory legal basis of the higher authorities have been cleared at central government level. However, a persistently large number of fee-charging items not covered by local government laws should now be the focus of the next step toward lowering costs.\n3. Enhancing protection on private investment. Since 2010, China’s consumption has exceeded its investment. It is widely believed that economic growth has reached a turning point towards being primarily driven by consumption and supplemented by investment. In fact, investment – especially private investment – still has great potential for growth. Internationally, both Japan and the Republic of Korea have experienced high investment and high growth for a significant amount of time. Domestically, despite the rapid increase of resident leverage in recent years, the upturn in residents’ disposable income is still higher than that of consumption, which means savings are still rising. Eventually, residents’ leverage ratios will steadily decline, and the savings rate can be maintained at a certain level, which can lay a foundation for substantial investment growth. Moving forward, under the context of a limited space for concentrated governmental investment, China will focus on strengthening the effective protection of property rights and contracts and improving legal justice to provide a guaranteed external environment for the survival and development of enterprises – especially privately-owned enterprises – and fully mobilise the enthusiasm for private investment.\n4. Continuing opening‑up to the outside world and advocating globalisation. China will firmly safeguard multilateralism, support the multilateral trade system, oppose various kinds of protectionism and build an open world economy. It will strengthen its involvement with international economic and trade rules, implement more active import policies, ease market access in the financial services industry and continue to expand market access in other fields. China will establish international advanced rules as the standard, give free-trade zones greater reform autonomy and improve their quality. Based on the lessons of free-trade zone pilots, China will implement pre-established national treatment with negative lists to create a fair, transparent and predictable market environment under the rule of law. If the flow of elements, the streamlining of administration and delegation of powers, the protection of private investment, and the continued and reinforced opening‑up are in place, the business environment in China will further improve. There is also reason to believe that the economic growth in the next period will be maintained at a high level of greater than 6%.\n5. Preventing and resolving financial risks. Failure to achieve this could lead to subversive consequences. Currently, the ratio of M2 to GDP in China exceeds 200% – roughly equal to that of Japan and more than double the US’s 91%. However, the average one-month Shanghai Interbank Offer Rate (Shibor) in 2017 in China was 4.09%. In the same period, the comparable interest rate in Japan was –0.01%, and that of the US was 1.1%.13 China’s monetary environment is more relaxed while the cost of capital is even higher, indicating a serious distortion of the financial system. Overmixed operation – ‘comprehensive management’ – has caused financial chaos; there is a wide variety of derivatives with Chinese characteristics: peer, channel, nesting, capital pool, universal insurance of Ponzi financing, peer-to-peer, non-standard and payday loans superimpose on one other, resulting in the cost of capital constantly rising and the real economy becoming exacerbated. Simultaneously,  channels of risk transmission are extremely opaque. Compared with the US financial market a decade ago – where the characteristics of risk and reward for various derivatives, such as mortgaged-backed securities (MBSs) and collateral debt obligations, were not fully understood although they are now fully recorded – China is even more chaotic and needs to scrutinise the underlyings of the products to identify the true risks and benefits. In addition to conventional banking, securities, insurance and funds, new and innovative financial and quasi-financial institutions with Chinese characteristics and regional exchange markets have been created. In this way, it is very likely that there are systemic financial risks in China. The immediate task is now to win the battle of risk prevention and control.\n\nChina can overcome this difficult challenge with hard work. First, senior leaders must understand the situation. President Xi Jinping advised at the 2015 Economic Work Conference that China “must step up the special rectification of financial risks and resolutely reject systematic regional risks”. Taking the US scenario a decade ago as an example, Hank Paulson, former US Treasury secretary, explained to the author that shortly after he had taken office in 2006 he felt financial risks were swirling like a brewing storm, but there was no consensus in society and no means of preventing the outbreak of risks.\nSecond is an understanding of the situation by governments and financial institutions. Following President Xi’s instructions, governments, and regulatory agencies in particular, have already taken actions to request the return of assets, tighten their trade contracts and strictly control disguised bonds issued by local governments. Financial institutions are also stepping up their efforts to control risks. This highlights that society has recognised the occurrence of a ‘grey rhino’ incident. At that time, there was no consensus in the US financial community except for warnings from a handful of people such as Paulson, economist Ben Bernanke and former president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and Secretary of the Treasury Tim Geithner. At that time, the grey rhino was merely a possibility and there was no expectation that the grey rhino would turn into a ‘black swan’. Crisis accumulation is competing with consensus on remediation formation – the former has been running in front, and there was no remediation of chaos or consensus on rescuing a systematic outbreak of risk until the downfall of Lehman Brothers and the emergence of black swan incidents.\nThird, awareness of the key risks is essential. President Xi once said: “We must not forget that housing is for living in, not for speculation”, and “Finance should return to its origin and serve the real economy”. This emphasises that the major risk points are financialised real estate and unanchored finance. Before the outbreak of the financial crisis in the US, the American Dream of owning a home was embraced by all US citizens, regardless of how implausible it was to achieve. Financial markets were subsequently flooded with MBSs, with mortgages as underlying assets and derivatives. Eventually, these became intertwined, giving rise to risks.\nFourth, the overall environment must be considered. After the outbreak of the financial crisis, the Group of 20 summit and a series of financial channel meetings saved the global economy with joint efforts, and aided the prompt formation of consensus on strengthening financial supervision and helped to roll out concrete measures. There is reason for confidence, as China’s supervision of major financial institutions is now effectively in line with international standards, and major financial institutions are relatively healthy. In the US, where the environment was not so good when the crisis broke out, risks were concentrated in seven major financial institutions.\nThe comparison drawn between the US and China during the financial crisis offers a number of lessons – many of which are unique to China. These include the proliferation of transactional derivatives with Chinese characteristics, and the establishment of new and innovative financial and quasi-financial institutions and regional exchange markets with Chinese features, as well as difficulty in regulation. Combating financial risks is a long-term prospect, as Liu He, vice premier of the People’s Republic of China, said earlier this year at the World Economic Forum Annual Meeting in Davos: “We will strive to win the battle against financial risks in the next three years or so.”14 If the problem can be resolved in around three years, so too can the problem of high nominal interest rates.\nFifth, China’s introspection towards its future financial model must be considered. It is interesting that China is a global financial market, while mixed operations are rapidly developing with high risks. In the past, some local leaders have been keen on developing local trading markets, but found it too difficult to exercise regulation. Risks in regional markets will inevitably face spillovers that can be very tricky to handle, which is why these leaders are carefully reviewing these issues.\nAs making qualitative judgements on future patterns becomes increasingly challenging, the author posits the following:\nPresident Xi emphasised that “finance should return to its origin and serve the real economy”. Should we adhere to the mode of mixed operation to have finance return to its origins? Are we capable of confronting complicated challenges on financial regulation brought by mixed operations? Is it necessary for financial institutions to bear high compliance costs once mixed supervision is implemented? Is it necessary for the real economy to pay excessive nominal interests? Is this due to high compliance cost spillovers or high-risk pricing brought by overmixed operation or multiple derivatives. In the 1990s, then-Premier of China Zhu Rongji insisted on separate management, knowing that mixed operation was destined to fail at that particular stage, as citizens were neither well disciplined nor law-abiding enough, and institutions lacked the capabilities of regulation.\nUnder his insistence, The segregation supervision pattern of the China Banking Regulatory Commission, the China Securities Regulatory Commission and the China Insurance Regulatory Commission was established, meaning financial institutions would be split according to their main businesses.15\nIn January 2010 – in the wake of the financial crisis – Nobel Prize winner and economist Paul Krugman wrote: “The US must learn from its neighbour, Canada. More specifically, Canada places more stringent restrictions on the leverage of the banking sector and limits the securitisation process. These constraints in Canada in recent years, undoubtedly, have made bankers lose many opportunities to come up with so-called clever ideas, but these restrictions have all proved to be correct.”16 Observations of financial markets worldwide often find that those in Canada are considered the most ‘boring’  as financial authorities strictly regulate and control mixed operation, limit the appearance and trading of derivatives, prevent infection of financial risks and make every effort to enable financial consumers to achieve the co-ordinated development of finance with the real economy. However, even after the global financial crisis, Canada’s banking system was still rated by Standard & Poor’s and the International Monetary Fund as the healthiest banking system in the world. Its experience therefore deserves our attention and reflection.\nThe report of the 19th CPC National Congress reminds us that the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation can by no means be easily achieved and the endeavour to accomplish the two centenary goals will not always be smooth. President Xi’s remarks in January 2018 implore China to ramp up its vigilance towards danger and perservere in preventing risks.\nAs long as China conscientiously implements the spirit of the 19th CPC National Congress, persists in deepening supply-side structural reform and resolutely guards against risks and challenges – particularly keeping away from global risks that may delay or interrupt the great rejuvenation process and high-quality economic development – we will certainly be able to fulfil the Chinese Dream of rejuvenating the Chinese nation.\n\nNotes\n1.

No, it sounds like STUPID TRADE – going on for years!” tweeted Trump.\nThe US has threatened to levy tariffs of up to US$150 billion worth on Chinese imports, complaining of unfair Chinese trade practices, including restrictions on market access and the alleged theft of intellectual property. Beijing responded with a list of American goods likely to face import tariffs as the trade dispute escalates.\nXi, however, told the audience in Hainan that the world has become the “Earth village” and it would go against historical trends to close up, suggesting that China did not want to engage in a trade war with the US or escalate trade tensions into a broader confrontation, at least not for now.\nChina “sincerely” hoped to buy more from foreign countries to satisfy domestic demand, he said.\nChina’s President Xi Jinping reveals economic plans at Boao Forum amid trade tensions with the US\nThe bulk of Xi’s speech at the event attended by regional political and business leaders, and promoted as Asia’s answer to the World Economic Forum in Davos, was about his vision for China’s place in the world order, trying to sooth worries about nation’s rise and stressing its emphasis on peaceful development.\n“We will never threaten anyone, nor overthrow the existing international system” no matter how rich or powerful China becomes, said Xi, who has become the most powerful Chinese leader since Mao Zedong.\n“We will not seek to build up spheres of influence – China will always be a builder for world peace, a contributor to global development and a defender of international order,” he said.\n\nXi did not name the United States or Trump in his speech, but he made clear that China supported a multilateral trade system and is against a “cold war mentality” or “zero-sum game”.\n“Being overbearing or isolationist can only hit walls,” Xi said. “Only by adhering to peaceful development and working hand in hand can we truly achieve multi-win and win-win results.”\nXi said China would proactively develop global partnerships and “firmly support multilateralism” for the sake of the “a community of common destiny” for all people, a phrase Xi favours to describe his future global vision.\nWho will be the winners and losers in a China-US trade war?\nThat vision was met with delight by Trump on Tuesday, as he tweeted: “Very thankful for President Xi of China’s kind words on tariffs and automobile barriers...also, his enlightenment on intellectual property and technology transfers. We will make great progress together!”\nThis is not the first time Beijing has pledged to further open up its economy amid criticism from foreign firms about the barriers to operating in China.\nXi delivered a speech at Davos last year soon after Trump took office, positioning himself as a champion of free trade and globalisation.\nVery thankful for President Xi of China’s kind words on tariffs and automobile barriers...also, his enlightenment on intellectual property and technology transfers. We will make great progress together!\n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 10, 2018\nSceptics, however, have questioned whether China’s government is genuinely committed to further opening up its economy.\nFor example, the “Made in China 2025” government-backed initiative to help secure a Chinese advantages in hi-tech industries such as robotics and electric vehicles, has created unease among other countries.\nTrump softens on China as Beijing ramps up rhetoric in show of toughness over trade spat\nXi tried to address these concerns on Tuesday, saying China would be serious about protecting intellectual property rights and will tweak its domestic regulations to comply with international economic and trade rules.\nMichael Clauss, the German ambassador to China, wrote in a note commenting on Xi’s speech that “promises to open up further have not been in short supply” but rhetoric alone would not change the fact that China was still extensively restricting foreign investment.\n“We hope this time we will actually see some meaningful implementation,” he said.\nChina’s forex reserves are up – and so are fears of a US trade war hit\nSingaporean Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said after Xi’s speech that he hoped China and the US would be able to work out a solution and keep from further escalation in their trade disputes.\n\n“A trade war between China and the US is still far from inevitable, but if one does happen it will undermine the multilateral trading system, which has underpinned global prosperity,” he said.\n“What is ultimately at stake is war and peace, the security and stability of the world.”\nThe message from Xi may help to cool trade tensions between China and the US.\nRobert Koopman, the chief economist at the World Trade Organisation, said it “would be very interesting to see the reception to Xi’s words today in Washington” as whether the speech start a conversation between the two sides.\nQian Keming, a Chinese vice commerce minister, said Beijing was trying to “set an example for the world in terms of market opening”.\n“We see the trade disputes with the US as a fight between free trade and protectionism,” he said.\nAdditional reporting by Wendy Wu in Beijing and Sarah Zheng in Hong Kong\nYou are signed up.

The dollar was down about 1 per cent against the yen.\nThe dollar has been pressured for months by the view that the Federal Reserve is no longer the only game in town when it comes to tighter monetary policy as growth in other regions, Europe in particular, picks up speed.\nEuro zone businesses kicked off 2018 in much better shape than anyone polled by Reuters expected, ramping up activity at the fastest rate since mid-2006, a survey showed.\nInvestors were keenly awaiting the European Central Bank’s meeting on Thursday for clues on the outlook for euro zone monetary policy.\nThe euro may have more room to rise given the negative sentiment around the US dollar, Trang said.\nSterling jumped above US$1.42 after strong British employment data helped extend a recent rally driven by optimism Britain will have a relatively smooth exit from the European Union.\nYou are signed up.

Their wish is not only to save themselves from globalisation, but to change the natural flow of globalisation,” Modi said at the opening of the forum, which has attracted 70 heads of state and government, chief executives and top bankers.\n“The result of this is that we are seeing new types of tariff and non-tariff-based barriers being imposed. Bilateral and multilateral trade negotiations appear to have come to a halt.\n“There is a slowdown in cross-border financial investments and the expansion of [the] global supply chain appears to have slowed down.”\nTrump has been pushing an “America First” policy of getting businesses to invest in the United States instead of overseas, potentially affecting the growth prospects of emerging economies such as India dependent on foreign investment.\nDuring his 2016 election campaign, he blamed globalisation for ravaging US manufacturing jobs as companies sought to reduce labour costs by relocating to Mexico and elsewhere. Trump is due to address the forum on Friday.\nExperts argue Trump doesn’t understand trade deficits ahead of visit to World Economic Forum in Switzerland\nBlackRock vice-chairman Philipp Hildebrand said Trump’s protectionist US trade policies were the biggest risk to a global economic recovery.\n“It all depends on what ‘America First’ means,” he said. “If it means to fundamentally unravel and destroy the global trading order in a highly complicated supply chain world that would be bad news for the global economy.”\nMeanwhile, the American leader’s recent US$1.5 trillion tax overhaul drew praise and warnings from finance chiefs at the annual meeting.\nA month since Trump slashed the corporate tax rate to 21 per cent from 35 per cent and cut individual levies across the board, Stephen Schwarzman, the chief executive officer of Blackstone Group LP, said such reductions would spark investment in the US.\n“There are going to be a lot of flows into the United States, and this is an underestimated to forgotten aspect of the US tax reform,” Schwarzman said. “There are companies all around the world now looking at US, saying this is the place to be in the developed world,”\nBut not everyone at the gathering – where billionaires, world leaders and investors hobnob and discuss topics ranging from the global economy and sexual harassment, to the risks and opportunities of artificial intelligence – were sold on Trump’s tax overhaul.\nBrian Moynihan, chief executive of Bank of America Corp., said a 4.1 per cent unemployment rate meant the “reality of bringing a lot of jobs back is difficult. Where are the people to do the work?”\nFrank Appel, the chief executive of Deutsche Post AG, predicted the tax cut would deliver a “limited short-term impact”, but would swell the budget deficit and wouldn’t do anything to boost productivity.\nThe debate came a day after the International Monetary Fund cited the tax revamp as a reason it now expected stronger expansion globally this year and next. But it added the effect would wear off by 2022 as some of the individual cuts expire and the US tries to curb its budget deficit.\nReporting by Reuters and Bloomberg\nYou are signed up.

The right to attend these schools, however, is limited to the offspring of homeowners, rather than tenants.\n\"Improving the rental market is an important part of housing reform and improving people's lives. It is part of Guangzhou's long-term residential plan,\" said an official with the Guangzhou Housing and Urban-Rural Construction Committee.\nUnder the new regulation, tenants who hold a Guangzhou \"hukou\" (household registration), or a skilled worker certificate, will be able to enroll their children in elementary and middle schools.\nSun Bushu, deputy director of South China City Research Association, called the regulation \"commendable\" as it addresses issues in the property market and will help attract more people with skills to the city.\nHowever, the fact that education resources are lacking remains unchanged, and it is not possible to guarantee complete equal rights for everyone, Sun said.\nThere may also be risks that rents around very good schools will soar, he said.\nIn the work plan, Guangzhou has also promised to assign more houses for rent and allow estate agents to renovate old apartments and dilapidated buildings.\n\n\n\n\n"}
