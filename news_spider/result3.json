Benioff, chairman and CEO of Salesforce, adding that \"if anything trumps trust, we're in trouble\".\nAmazon's Alexa now has a built-in camera that can rate what a person is wearing, recommend upgrades to their wardrobe and order with a single click. Is it right that technology not only does things for us, but also decides things for us?\nOnline retailers such as Amazon now gather so much data that they know more about users than the users themselves, raising serious questions about the privacy of that data and who has the authority to use and monetize it.\nAccording to Benioff, the signs are pointing towards more regulation.\n\"When CEOs don't take responsibility, then governments have no choice but to step in,\" he said.\nBenioff likened the accelerating power of today's technology to the complex financial products of a decade ago. Regulators weren't paying sufficient attention then, and the headlong rush into mortgage-backed derivatives and the like created the worst financial crash for generations.\n\"Regulators need to adapt much faster to the new reality,\" he stressed.\nThere is a political angle to this argument too, said Sir Martin Sorrell, CEO of British company WPP, one of the world's largest advertising companies, adding that the spread of artificial intelligence, driverless cars and stores with no workers or check-outs is making ordinary people nervous, because their job will be in danger.\n\"With the tech space increasingly dominated by a handful of huge players, such as Apple, Google and Facebook, regulation of data sharing, privacy and responsibility for platform content is an increasingly urgent issue,\" Sorrell argued.\nThe World Economic Forum's 48th Annual Meeting is taking place on Jan. 23-26 in Davos-Klosters, Switzerland, with more than 3,000 leaders from around the world expecting to attend some 400 discussions.\nIn pics: Taikonaut Corps of PLA\nLaba Festival marked around China\n23 French departments on orange alert on floods risk\nFuneral of Dolores O'Riordan held in Limerick\nScenery of snow-covered Crescent spring and Mingsha Mountain\nTianjin greets first snowfall this winter\nTurkish troops enter Syria's Afrin on second day of offensive\nDPRK sends advance team of orchestra for concerts during South Korea-hosted Winter Olympics\n"}

And although Liu He is no stranger to the annual gathering of the world’s business and political elite, he has not previously been the one giving the speech.\nOn Wednesday, Liu – who is a strong candidate to take charge of the country’s economy for the next five years – told the world’s rich and powerful in the Swiss resort town that China would open its domestic markets wider and that this year’s reform measures could “exceed the international community’s expectations”.\nLiu, 66, is leading the Chinese delegation at the World Economic Forum, and he has been given the same status as the most important leaders. He is the only policymaker who is not a state leader to speak in one of 10 sessions hosted by executive chairman Klaus Schwab. Other speakers to take the chair beside Schwab include US President Donald Trump, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, UK Prime Minister Theresa May, French President Emmanuel Macron and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi.\n\nWednesday’s speech also marks the first time Liu – who is seen as the brains behind Xi’s supply-side structural reform concept – has spoken at length in public about the country’s future economic direction since he was introduced by Xi to a visiting US delegation in 2013 as a person who was “very important to me”.\nLiu is the director of the Office of the Central Leading Group for Financial and Economic Affairs and a vice-chairman of the top planning body, the National Development and Reform Commission.\nHow Liu He went from government researcher to Xi’s right-hand man\nSince Liu was elevated to the 25-member Politburo at the 19th party congress in October, it has been widely expected that he would take a front seat in steering the Chinese economy.\nThe Harvard-educated technocrat, who has until now stayed mainly behind the scenes, could be made China’s vice-premier in charge of economic and financial affairs in March.\nAnalysts said the annual Davos meeting was the perfect stage for Liu to make his debut.\n“Liu has been the man behind China’s main economic and financial policies in recent years, like a Chinese version of Larry Summers,” Zhao Xijun, a finance professor with Renmin University said, referring to the former director of the National Economic Council to president Barack Obama.\nLi Keqiang calls for more targeted tack on economic overhaul\n“He’s a suitable person to communicate China’s economic blueprint and its commitments to globalisation and market opening to the world” because of his deep understanding of the Chinese economy and experience in drafting policies, Zhao said.\nLiu, who delivered his half-hour speech in Mandarin, said China’s economy was improving and the country was on course to become wealthier. He also called for joint efforts to address global issues ranging from climate change to fighting terrorism.\n“History may repeat itself when we find we’re at a similar crossroads,” Liu said. “At that moment, making cautious and rational choices will be very important as no country alone can win the battle against terrorism and the double-edged sword of technological development.”\nThis year’s Davos meeting could be the pivot for global trade\nIt is not the first time Liu has attended the ritzy gathering, but last year he was in the audience listening to Xi championing free trade and globalisation.\n“A trade war will only lead to suffering on both sides,” Xi told thousands of business and political leaders a year ago, in a speech widely read as criticism of Trump and a symbol of China’s growing influence on the world stage.\nAnd like most of his other overseas trips with Xi, Liu did not make any public comments at the time.\nBack in 1993, he attended Davos for the first time as a junior government official and took part in a round-table debate about the future of the world economy.\n“I was the lowest-ranking official at the table but got most of the questions,” Liu was quoted as saying in 2008.\nFast-forward to 2018, and Liu is now the face of the world’s second biggest economy at the event, and he is promising change.\n“China’s reform and opening up started in 1978 and has created China’s economic growth miracle,” Liu said. “The best way of commemorating the 40th anniversary is to launch more forceful measures.”\nNarendra Modi tells World Economic Forum globalisation is losing its lustre\nHis remarks come after China recorded 6.9 per cent growth in gross domestic product last year – faster than the official target of around 6.5 per cent. Beijing has also stabilised the yuan exchange rate with capital curbs, ending a sharp currency depreciation seen in the second half of 2015 and in 2016 after missteps in adjusting the rate.\nIn China’s annual closed-door economic conference last month, the top leadership singled out three main tasks for the next three years: controlling financial risk, reducing poverty and curbing pollution. These key “battles” are in line with Liu’s thoughts laid out in his most recent academic paper, published in 2013, when he gave his explanation of the structural reasons for the 2008 global financial crisis and the Great Depression. He wrote that populism, loose monetary policies and an excessively large income gap were to blame for the crisis. “A Comparative Study of Two Global Crises” earned Liu China’s top economics award in 2014.\nYou are signed up.

There has never been a better time to hire, to build, to invest and to grow in the United States. America is open for business and we are competitive once again,” he told the audience of business and political leaders in the Swiss ski resort.\nPutting ‘America first’ will benefit the world, Trump claims in Davos speech\nTaking credit for economic growth in the US, Trump emphasised tax cuts and deregulation as drawcards for investment while again criticising countries he said exploited the system through “predatory behaviours”.\n“The United States will no longer turn a blind eye to unfair economic practices including massive intellectual property theft, industrial subsidies and pervasive state-led economic planning,” he said.\nAlthough he did not name China, analysts said Trump was clearly pointing the finger at Beijing, which he sees as a major competitor.\nWhat are the trade cards Donald Trump could play against China?\n“He changed his tone a little for the audience, but not the substance of his message. And he is taking significant economic measures against China irrespective of this speech,” said Shi Yinhong, who specialises in US studies at Renmin University in Beijing.\n“So Beijing won’t be impressed by this speech – instead it will be closely watching and should be ready to respond to his actions.”\nBefore Trump’s trip to Davos, the US on Monday announced steep tariffs of 30 per cent on imported washing machines and solar panels, which will hurt China – the world’s biggest producer of solar panels – and South Korea the most.\n\n“It looks like a trade war is a possibility,” said Jia Qingguo, head of international studies at Peking University.\nThis week, a US National Security Council spokesman said Trump had reiterated that the US would “use all available trade remedies to create a level playing field for United States workers and businesses”.\nIn the meantime, US tax and interest rate policies to attract multinationals could also hit other countries in the short term, and the analysts said China will be under pressure in both its real economy and foreign exchange controls.\nChina should also be ready to retaliate against trade restrictions, they said, and could also consider tax reforms to make the investment climate more appealing.\n“But it is also important for Beijing to keep up close and constant communication with Washington, to remind Trump that these moves are harmful to America as well,” Jia said.\nIn his speech, Trump insisted on negotiating bilaterally with trading partners, but he also said he would consider talks with the 11 remaining members of the Trans-Pacific Partnership “either individually, or perhaps as a group, if it is in the interests of all”.\nChina way more protectionist than US, says Trump official\nTrump’s first presidential order after he was sworn in last year was to withdraw from the trade pact linking nations around the Asia-Pacific region.\nScott Kennedy from the Centre for Strategic and International Studies said the reference to the TPP was the most unexpected part in the speech.\n“This shows that the administration is now clearly aware that it is in a fight with Beijing for the hearts, minds and wallets of countries in the Asia-Pacific, and the US needs to attract greater support for its strategy toward the region and China,” he said.\nChina’s economic mastermind Liu He steps out onto centre-stage at Davos\nTrump’s speech was a thoughtful retort to Chinese President Xi Jinping’s speech of a year ago, Kennedy added.\n“[Trump] argued that a prosperous American economy is important to global prosperity and that intensive government market interventions and industrial policy is a danger to the global economy,” Kennedy said.\n\nLast year at Davos, Xi made a keynote speech championing free trade and globalisation, and underscoring Beijing’s desire for a world leadership role.

Here’s the sign-up.)\nGood evening. Here’s the latest.\n1. President Trump is headed to the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, setting the stage for one of the most intriguing encounters of his year-old presidency.\nMr. Trump will bring his protectionist, “America First” message to “the snowy, mountaintop resort where financial titans mingle with heads of state in an annual saturnalia of capitalism,” as our White House correspondent puts it.\nBefore he left, Mr. Trump told reporters that he was willing to speak under oath with Robert Mueller, the special counsel in the investigation into Russian meddling in the election, ending months of speculation.\n____\n2. Meanwhile, the immigration debate rages at home. Senator Chuck Schumer, the Democratic leader, above, says a border wall is off the table. And the bipartisan group of rank-and-file senators who came together to end the shutdown are setting their sights on an immigration deal.\nSeparately, the administration is increasing pressure on so-called sanctuary cities. The Justice Department sent letters to 23 local governments demanding proof they had not kept information from federal immigration authorities.\n____\n3. “It is my honor and privilege to sentence you.”\nThat was Judge Rosemarie Aquilina sentencing Larry Nassar, above, the former doctor for the American gymnastics team, to 40 to 175 years in prison for sexually abusing athletes in his care.\nDr. Nassar, 54, had already been sentenced to 60 years on child pornography charges. Noting the length of the new sentence, Judge Aquilina added, “I just signed your death warrant.”\nWe collected some of the powerful statements from the more than 150 victims who spoke at his sentencing.\n____\n4. In China, women are also trying to forge a #MeToo movement.\nBut they face a male-dominated culture and censors who delete online petitions and scrub social media of phrases like “anti-sexual harassment.”\n“So many sincere and eager voices are being muted,” said Zhang Leilei, above, an activist in the southern city of Guangzhou.\n____\n5. Tuesday’s deadly shooting in Kentucky was the 11th on a school property this year in the U.S. And we’re not even through January.\nResearchers and gun control advocates say that since 2013, they have logged school shootings at a rate of about one a week.\nTwo students were killed Tuesday in Kentucky, and 18 others were wounded. Prosecutors said the 15-year-old suspect, also a student, would be charged as an adult. Above, students embraced after a vigil at a nearby high school.\n____\n6. The U.S. is accusing Syria’s government of another chlorine gas attack on civilians, and has rebuked Russia for failing to stop such a war crime.\nSeparately, a strategic city in Syria, Manbij, is emerging as the ultimate target of the Turkish offensive into Kurdish-controlled territory, seen above.\nThe assault could bring Turkish forces into direct conflict with American troops stationed there, with unpredictable results. President Trump warned his Turkish counterpart, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, about the growing conflict in a phone call on Wednesday. Mr. Erdogan, for his part, demanded that the U.S. end its support for Kurdish militias.\n____\n7. A reporter in Alabama may have found the wreckage of the last known slave ship in the U.S.\nThe ship, the Clotilda, carried 110 enslaved people from West Africa to the Alabama coast in 1860. The slaves were unloaded and the ship was set ablaze after it landed, as the smugglers tried to evade the authorities.\nThe recent “bomb cyclone” created extremely low tides in the Mobile-Tensaw Delta, exposing charred beams forming the shape of a vessel with almost the exact dimensions of the Clotilda.\n____\n8. In Saudi Arabia, 12 camels were disqualified from a beauty contest after their owners used Botox on their lips.\nThe contestants at the King Abdulaziz Camel Festival had to adhere to one condition: All beauty must be “natural.”\nThe monthlong festival, the largest in the Persian Gulf, features up to 30,000 camels and has so far attracted at least 300,000 visitors.\n____\n9. Valentine’s Day might be three weeks away, but it is certainly not too early to start thinking about gifts.\nOur experts from the Styles section and Wirecutter, a New York Times company that reviews products, put their heads together for this gift guide.\nThere are really good versions of the usual ideas, like champagne and chocolates. And then there are less obvious items, like cameras, kids’ books, ideas for the newly single and winter boots.\nYes, that’s right: comfortable footwear. It’s romantic.\n____\n10. Finally, the 60th annual Grammy Awards are on Sunday night.\nWe talked to the R&B singer SZA, who is the most nominated woman, with five nods including best new artist, for her debut album “Ctrl.” She was once filled with self-doubt, second-guessing the album so thoroughly that its release was delayed by a year.\n“I never imagined anything like this would happen in a million years,” she said.\nHave a great night.\n____\nYour Evening Briefing is posted at 6 p.m. Eastern.\nAnd don’t miss Your Morning Briefing, posted weekdays at 6 a.m. Eastern, and Your Weekend Briefing, posted at 6 a.m. Sundays.\nWant to catch up on past briefings?

{"title": "How Mnuchin's words in Davos could send the US dollar spiralling", "author": "South China Morning Post", "pub_time": "2018年1月29日", "url": "http://www.scmp.com/business/banking-finance/article/2131132/how-mnuchins-words-davos-could-send-us-dollar-spiralling", "content": "\nThe Treasury Secretary hasn’t entirely disowned the strong US dollar mantra but his approach seems more nuanced. His problem is that markets don’t always do nuances\nComments:\n\nAt last week’s World Economic Forum (WEF) in Davos, no one made US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin refer to the benefits to the United States accruing from a weaker dollar. He chose to. Mnuchin may have added to the greenback’s existing woes by casting doubt over the Treasury’s long-standing adherence to a strong dollar policy.\n“Obviously a weaker dollar is good for us as it relates to trade and opportunities,” Mnuchin said on Wednesday. Although his comments overall were even-handed and he shouldn’t be accused of directly trying to talk the greenback down, Mnuchin doesn’t seem to be on the same page as many of his predecessors.\nAs he said on a WEF panel on Thursday, presumably as part of an attempt to persuade markets that the importance of one comment on Wednesday had been overblown, Mnuchin nevertheless noted that his position “is perhaps slightly different from previous Treasury secretaries” who have argued for a strong US dollar. Mnuchin backs free and floating currencies.\nThat said, on Friday he told CNBC a strong “long-term dollar” is in US interests.\nBut by deviating, however subtly, from the straightforward strong US dollar mantra, Mnuchin has effectively let the currency market think it knows both that he himself has no issue with a weaker greenback in the short term and that the US government, which doesn’t like intervention by others in the currency market, would be a bystander to such a move.\n“Ultimately, I want to see a strong dollar,” President Trump said on Thursday, arguably as part of a damage limitation exercise, but markets cannot have failed to notice his use of the word “ultimately.”\nTrump may have decided to comment because if overseas investors perceive the US Treasury is institutionally calm about another fall in the greenback’s value, they could start to demand higher yields to compensate them for holding the depreciating currency just when the US government’s borrowing needs are on the rise following the passage of taxation reform in December.\nIn 1971 President Nixon triggered a devaluation of the US dollar by unilaterally cancelling its international convertibility to gold. US Treasury Secretary John Connally famously told his G-10 colleagues that the “dollar is our currency but it’s your problem.”\nBut by 1978 the falling value of the dollar was very much the US’ problem. President Carter’s administration issued Carter Bonds – US Treasury bonds denominated in West German Deutschmarks and Swiss francs – in part to shore up the value of a plummeting US dollar.\nThe greenback only truly recovered with the much tighter monetary policy adopted by Paul Volcker at the Federal Reserve after August 1979. By 1985, the greenback had risen so high that six nations agreed the Plaza Accord in September of that year to drive it down. Yet less than two years later the same six countries signed the Louvre Accord to try to halt the greenback’s post-Plaza fall.\nFast forward to President Clinton’s first term and in 1993 Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen had no qualms about calling for a lower dollar/yen exchange rate as a way of addressing the rising US trade deficit with Japan. But with Bentsen succeeded as Treasury Secretary by Robert Rubin in January 1995, the strong dollar policy was born.\nWhile not directly attributable to Bentsen’s use of the dollar to strong-arm Japan, US Treasury yields soared in 1994 as their prices fell. Rubin’s adoption of the strong dollar policy helped arrest its decline while in the process giving comfort to overseas investors who, with fears about a falling greenback somewhat assuaged, felt happier returning to the market to buy Treasuries to fund Uncle Sam.\nAdditionally a rising greenback reduces the risk of higher inflation through the import channel even though it makes American exporters less competitive.\nIn truth, Robert Rubin and his successor Larry Summers calibrated a strong dollar mantra where the rhetoric satisfied market participants that was the US Treasury’s official stance even if the greenback was trading on the soft side in the real world. The Treasury could have a policy of benign neglect towards the greenback but with markets still believing a strong US dollar policy was in place.\nMnuchin hasn’t disowned the strong US dollar mantra in its entirety but his approach to the greenback seems more nuanced. His problem is that markets don’t always do nuances. As a consequence of a few words uttered in the Swiss Alps last week the US dollar could begin a new downhill slide.\nYou are signed up.

{"title": "China Says It's Open for Business. Foreign Firms Find It's Not That ...", "author": "New York Times", "pub_time": "2017年12月6日", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/06/business/china-global-business-xi-jinping.html", "content": "Advertisement\nSupported by\nBy Alexandra Stevenson\nGUANGZHOU, China — The southern Chinese city of Guangzhou on Wednesday welcomed dozens of corporate leaders and foreign dignitaries with one overriding message: China is open for business.\nThe reality on the ground was more complex.\nChina is increasingly presenting itself as a global force: President Xi Jinping surprised the world in January when he told power brokers gathered in Davos, Switzerland, that the country planned to intensify its role in the absence of American leadership.\nThat message was echoed at the Guangzhou conference, which was attended by the leaders of companies like Apple, Ford Motor, Philips and Walmart and foreign leaders like Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada.\n“China’s door will not close to the world but open wider,” Mr. Xi said in a letter addressed to the gathering, which was organized by Fortune magazine. China’s president was to attend the conference until changing his plans at the last minute, according to local media reports. Wang Yang, China’s vice premier, spoke of the country’s commitment to a “nondiscriminatory environment for foreign companies.” Another senior Chinese official promised a level playing field for foreign businesses.\nBut the messages of openness contrasted sharply with actions taken in Beijing and elsewhere in the country. China wants its giant national companies to be world leaders in sectors like electric cars, robotics and drones, but the authorities are accused of curtailing foreign firms’ access to Chinese consumers.\nA government-led effort to help Chinese companies at home and abroad has set up a potential trade battle with the United States, as a growing number of American businesses complain that Chinese trade practices like forced technology transfer are putting them at a disadvantage.\nAt the conference in Guangzhou, multiple officials promoted what they called the “spirit” of the ruling Communist Party’s recent congress, which tightened Mr. Xi’s grip on the state gave his policies an exalted status in a sign of the role the party intends to play in China’s economy. The crowd in the cavernous ballroom at the Shangri-La Hotel thinned out as one official after another spoke over the course of an hour.\nSurveys of China business leaders by the American Chamber of Commerce in recent years have shown that many American companies do not think the playing field is even.\n“Chinese government statements reaffirming China’s commitment to providing a nondiscriminatory environment for foreign companies are always welcome, but need to be accompanied by real progress,” said Kenneth Jarrett, the president of the American Chamber of Commerce in Shanghai.\n“The challenges of China’s regulatory environment — its opaqueness, unpredictability and basic problems of market access — make it difficult for U.S. companies to realize their full potential,” he added.\nOthers were more blunt in their assessments.\n“You can get WeChat in America, but you can’t get Facebook here in China,” Terry Branstad, the United States ambassador to China said on Wednesday, referring to the popular Chinese social media app that is used by nearly 1 billion people. Facebook, by contrast, is blocked in China, although the company is still trying to get into the country.\n“We are hopeful that we can still continue to make progress, but there are still basic areas of concern,” Mr. Branstad added, referring to the growing frustration that China is demanding too many concessions from companies that want to compete in the country.\nOne company that has sought to make concessions in hopes of maintaining its access to the Chinese market is Apple. The company has been criticized for recently removing some apps from its China app store, including those meant to help users circumvent the country’s heavily censored internet. The company’s chief executive, Tim Cook, expressed respect for China’s rule of law at the conference on Wednesday.\n“When you go into a country and participate in the market, you are subject to the laws and regulation of that country,” Mr. Cook said, underscoring the notion that some American business leaders are willing to play by China’s rules. “You don’t bring the laws and regulations that you wish were there,” he added.\nMr. Cook had come to Guangzhou from the World Internet Conference, which was organized by the Cyberspace Administration of China. His attendance at that event raised concerns that he was lending his support to the government’s heavy-handed control over the internet.\nMr. Cook, responding to those concerns, said, “My view is that you show up and you participate because nothing ever changes from the sidelines.” He also said he hoped that some of the apps the company had made unavailable in China would one day be available there again.\nAgainst this backdrop, Chinese companies are beginning to claim some of the dominant positions that their foreign counterparts once had around the world. One of the many statistics that officials here cited to support China’s growing strength on the global stage was this one: The Fortune 500 list now includes 115 Chinese companies, nearly equal to the number of American companies.\nOne thing is clear: The days when foreign companies thought they could come to China and make a quick profit are over.\n“You cannot just be in the market to make money,” said Hans Tung, a managing partner at venture capital firm GGV Capital. “I think that if you can help the Chinese government to achieve its objective of being a model of growth, you’ll have achieved your own objective as well.”\nNot everyone every business leader here was quite as diplomatic.\n“People complain too much,” said Jack Ma, the founder of the e-commerce giant Alibaba. Mr. Ma’s company plays a dominant role in the lives of most Chinese consumers, and it has become a darling of United States investors and almost as valuable as Amazon.\n“If you cannot survive in China, I barely think you can survive in other countries,” Mr. Ma added, citing the success in China of American companies like IBM, Starbucks and Walmart.\nHis advice for foreign companies was simple: “Have patience and respect the rule of law.”\nFollow Alexandra Stevenson on Twitter: @jotted.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nCollapse\nSEE MY OPTIONS\n"}
{"title": "China to send Xi Jinping's right-hand man Liu He to Davos", "author": "South China Morning Post", "pub_time": "2018年1月15日", "url": "http://www.scmp.com/news/china/economy/article/2128340/china-send-xi-jinpings-right-hand-man-liu-he-davos-sources-say", "content": "\nChina economy\nDecision is latest sign he could be in line to become the next vice-premier in charge of economic and financial affairs\nComments:\n\nLiu He, top economic aide to President Xi Jinping, will lead the Chinese delegation at the World Economic Forum in Davos next week.\nThe decision to send Liu to the ritzy summit in the Swiss Alps resort town is the latest sign that the 66-year-old could be in line to become China’s next vice-premier in charge of economic and financial affairs.\nThe official Xinhua news agency confirmed on Monday that Liu would head up the delegation.\nLiu is director of the Office of the Central Leading Group for Financial and Economic Affairs and a vice-chairman of the country’s top planning body, the National Development and Reform Commission.\nAppointments of key positions such as China’s vice-premiers and other cabinet figures will be announced in March during the annual parliamentary session. Liu, who is widely seen as the mastermind behind Xi’s supply-side structural reform concept, was promoted to the 25-member Politburo at the 19th party congress in October.\nWhere will Liu He, the mastermind of China’s economic policies, go next?\nXi made a surprise appearance at Davos last year, singing the praises of free trade and globalisation. US President Donald Trump will follow in his footsteps at next week’s gathering, though his message – promoting the “America first” policy – will be quite different.\nFrench president Emmanuel Macron is also expected to attend, and German Chancellor Angela Merkel may also join the annual four-day summit of political and business elites, which begins on January 23.\n\nWhile Liu is not a direct counterpart of Trump, Macron or Merkel, the Harvard-educated Chinese official is a key decision maker on China’s economic and financial policies.\nLiao Qun, chief economist at China Citic Bank International, said the decision showed Liu was now among the high-ranking officials in Beijing.\n“He’s become a member of the Politburo and will be expected to oversee China’s finance and economic policies [at the National People’s Congress] in March,” Liao said. “Davos is focused on the economy, so Liu is an appropriate choice to head the delegation, even if he’s not the president. But he’s an expert [on the economy] and a high-ranking official who has a close relationship with Xi.”\nChinese leaders have in previous years used the Davos forum to send a policy message to the international community. Former premier Wen Jiabao talked up Beijing’s huge stimulus plan to counter the global financial crisis in 2009, while Premier Li Keqiang tried to ease concerns about China’s economic slowdown with a speech on the “new normal” growth that is slower and more sustainable in 2015. Two years ago, Vice-President Li Yuanchao used his appearance at Davos to defend the yuan.\nHow Liu He went from government researcher to Xi’s right-hand man\nBut this practice reached its zenith last year when Xi took centre-stage at the event, becoming the first Chinese president to attend the forum as he presented the country as a champion of globalisation.\n“A trade war will only lead to suffering on both sides,” Xi told thousands of business and political leaders at the Swiss ski resort. “Those who push for protectionism are shutting themselves inside a dark house. They have escaped the rain and clouds outside, but also missed the light and air.”\nXi’s speech was widely read as a criticism of Trump and a symbol of China’s growing influence on the world stage as the US is taking a step back from global leadership.\nTrump will be the first US president to attend the summit of the world’s rich and powerful in almost two decades – the last US leader seen at this gathering was Bill Clinton in 2000.\nAdditional reporting by Sidney Leng\nYou are signed up.

{"title": "Chinese President Xi Jinping's top economic aide fails to inspire at ...", "author": "South China Morning Post", "pub_time": "2018年1月29日", "url": "http://www.scmp.com/news/china/economy/article/2131029/chinese-president-xi-jinpings-top-economic-aide-fails-inspire", "content": "\nChina economy\nLiu He might have sound personal credentials, but his promises of further reform only parroted Beijing’s pre-approved rhetoric, observers say\nComments:\n\nDespite his promise to foreign business executives to open up and reform China’s markets “beyond expectations” in 2018, observers struggled to find anything new in the speech made by Chinese President Xi Jinping’s top economic aide Liu He in Davos last week.\n“Unlike Xi Jinping’s bold speech from a year ago, Liu gave a safe speech, safe for his domestic and international audiences,” said Scott Kennedy, director of the project on Chinese business and political economy at the Centre for Strategic and International Studies in Washington.\n“There were multiple references to Xi Jinping, much touting of China’s economic success, and he held out the vague possibility of liberalisation,” he said.\n“He entirely avoided the deep tensions between China’s rhetoric in support of free trade and globalisation, and its highly interventionist industrial policy system and policies that he has played a central part in managing over the past five years.”\nChina’s economic mastermind Liu He steps out onto centre-stage at Davos\nSpeaking at the World Economic Forum in the Swiss town, Harvard-trained policymaker Liu said China would introduce more reforms to open up its economy this year and that “some measures will exceed the expectations of the international community”.\nUnsurprisingly, in his more than half an hour speech the 66-year-old director of the Office of the Central Leading Group for Financial and Economic Affairs, failed to provide any details of what form that opening up might take.\nInstead, the man on course to become China’s vice-premier in charge of economic and financial affairs – his appointment is expected to be announced at the country’s legislative sessions in March – largely repeated what the top leadership said last year. Namely, that the world’s second-largest economy would push ahead with its supply-side reforms, pursue high-quality rather than high-speed growth, and would make curbing financial risk, alleviating poverty and preventing pollution its top priorities.\nChina should ‘be ready for a trade war’ after Donald Trump’s Davos speech\nFor Mats Harborn, president of the European Union Chamber of Commerce in China, Liu’s speech lacked commitment.\n“While the European chamber recognises that some important initiatives have taken place in the last year, the direct impact on most foreign businesses has been limited,” he said.\n“There is a frustrating gap between promises and action. A clear implementation timeline is now required.”\nIn his speech, Liu repeated an early promise made by Xi that China would further open up its financial markets, and said the government would enhance intellectual property protection, and ease the investment restrictions on foreign firms in the manufacturing and services sectors.\nChina’s new growth model will ‘create opportunities’ for foreign firms\nSteve Tsang, director of the SOAS China Institute at the University of London, said that despite Liu’s promises, it would be unwise for the global business community to think that anyone other than Xi was steering the ship when it came to China’s economic direction.\n“Liu was hand-picked by Xi and it would make good sense to use his expertise in economic policy and the positive image he has to take charge of and deliver the economic reform package. But it will be naive to expect that it means Liu can proceed as he sees fit,” he said.\n“Xi … clearly intends to leave his mark on the Communist Party and on China, so it is reasonable to expect that he will want to push for the changes he wants now that he has consolidated power. Liu’s speech confirms such an intention.”\nHow Liu He went from government researcher to Xi’s right-hand man\nSince Liu was elevated to the 25-member Politburo at the 19th party congress in October, he has been widely expected to take a front-row seat in helping to steer the Chinese economy.\n“[But] He will work closely with Xi and will only deliver a programme that Xi agrees to and approves of,” Tsang said.\n“The Davos rhetoric should not be seen as anything more [or less] than that. It is what Xi and Liu would like the top corporate world to hear. The Chinese government will implement policies that the [Communist] party judges as being good for China and the party, not what will be good for the Davos crowd. Nor will they see anything Liu said at Davos as tying the hands of the Chinese government,” he said.\nChinese leaders identify top three economic battles: risk, poverty and pollution\nAndrew Collier, managing director of Orient Capital Research in Shanghai, took a similar view. While acknowledging Liu’s personal credentials, he said he was unlikely to find it easy to push through any reforms or changes that were not already on the party’s agenda.\n“Liu He is widely respected globally and has a reputation as a reformer. His short stint at Harvard has given him a taste of Western academic training, plus he has many contacts outside China,” he said.\n“However, despite the leadership’s commitment to reform, there has been little evidence of progress. This is due to a combination of an overly centralised political structure at the top and difficult financial issues among local governments at the bottom. Liu is going to have a tough time tackling the reforms he is hoping to achieve.”\nMore targeted reform and innovation key to China’s economic renewal, Chinese Premier Li Keqiang says\nZhu Haibin, an economist with JP Morgan Chase, said he found it interesting that Liu was upbeat in his assessment of the global economic outlook for 2018.\n“In previous years, when Xi or Premier Li Keqiang talked about the global economy their tone was balanced, but this time [it] was much more positive,” he said.\n“The possible implication is that that might allow more room for domestic reforms.”\nHenry Chan Hing Lee, an adjunct research fellow at the National University of Singapore’s East Asia Institute, said it was also noteworthy that Liu said China would bring its overall leverage ratio under effective control in three years.\n“The issue of over-leverage is often cited, both by the government and overseas observers, as the key danger to the Chinese economy,” he said.\nAdditional reporting by Sidney Leng\nYou are signed up.

Et comment comprendre la réplique de Washington prêt à taxer de son côté plusieurs centaines de biens de consommation Made in China ?\nLors d’un entretien avec Henry Kissinger en avril 2013, le tout nouveau président Xi Jinping affirmait pourtant que « l'établissement d'un nouveau type de relations entre les puissances que sont la Chine et les États-Unis nécessite une accumulation de concessions mutuelles ».\nOr, depuis l'avènement de Trump à la Maison Blanche la rivalité commerciale entre les États-Unis et la Chine structure désormais la politique étrangère et stratégique de ces pays. Un sérieux objet d’inquiétudes de part et d’autre du Pacifique.\nRead more: La nouvelle Route de la Soie, une stratégie d’influence mondiale de la Chine\nLa balance commerciale entre la Chine et les États-Unis continue de se creuser. En 2017, l’excédent commercial chinois s’élève (selon les douanes chinoises) à 375,2  milliards de dollars.\nOr cet excédent continue de progresser (environ 20 % au premier trimestre par rapport au début de l’année 2017), du fait des imposantes capacités commerciales chinoises.\nPékin est aussi le plus gros créancier de Washington avec environ 1200 milliards de dollars de bons du Trésor.\nDébut avril, Trump martelait que le gouvernement de Xi était « le plus grand manipulateur de devises de tout les temps », et devrait être donc puni. Quelques jours auparavant, lors d’une rencontre de haut niveau avec une délégation du Congrès américain, le Premier Ministre Li Keqiang avertissait que la Chine était «  parfaitement préparée à des contre-mesures, à des ripostes  » face à l'agressivité américaine.\nLa crise entre Washington et Pékin témoigne d’une lutte pour le leadership entre les deux grandes puissances : d’un côté, les États-Unis durcissent le ton et renforcent leur système de protection face une puissance en plein expansion.\nDe l’autre, la Chine dissipe l’idée d’une « menace chinoise  » et répond indirectement aux tensions.\nCette situation tendue intervient au moment où la Chine tente de moderniser ses infrastructures financières en misant notamment sur les nouvelles technologies et ainsi de gagner en puissance et en stabilité.\nUne perspective que Trump essaye d’enrayer.\nLes sanctions américaines sur les produits chinois ont été au coeur de la campagne de Donald Trump, malgré les nombreuses critiques soulignant que ce protectionnisme à outrance servirait avant tout les intérêts du Parti-État chinois.\nEn 2018 pourtant, dès le 22 janvier, à la veille du Forum de Davos, Trump persiste et annonce une série de sanctions tarifaires et de taxes contre sur les panneaux solaires, les machines à laver ainsi que sur des métaux comme l’aluminium et l’acier, inquiétant un moment les intérêts européens et japonais.\nComme prévu, Pékin a répliqué courant mars en publiant une liste de 128 produits américains qui seraient taxés de 15 à 25 % en cas d’échec de négociations commerciales avec Washington, représentant une perte potentielle de 3 milliards de dollars pour l'état américain. Il s'agit essentiellement de produits agro-alimentaires, tubes d’acier et produits d’aluminium recyclés.\nLe 22 mars les États-Unis publient une liste de 1300 produits chinois (d'un montant totalisant environ 50 milliards de dollars) pouvant être taxés à l'importation jusqu'à à 25 %..\nLes fleurons industriels chinois tels que Huawei ou ZTE, grands concurrents des leaders américains sont particulièrement ciblés.\nTrump menace également la Chine de 100 milliards de dollars de taxes supplémentaires en application de l'article 301 (notamment sur la propriété intellectuelle).\nLes avancées technologiques, notamment le programme chinois « Made in China 2025 » de modernisation de l'ensemble appareil industriel sont aussi dans le viseur du président américain.\nCe programme a été lancé en 2015 et promu par Li Keqiang. Une [dizaine de secteurs clés de l’industrie sont concernées. « Made in China 2025 » entend fabriquer « maison » des machines-outils, des équipements agricoles, transports, nouveaux matériaux de pointe destinés aussi bien à la construction navale qu'à l’aéronautique.\nLe gouvernement chinois investit largement (des subventions, des prêts et des obligations) pour soutenir les entreprises nationales de haute technologie et les encourager à s'étendre à l'étranger.\nCette stratégie industrielle sur 10 ans se déploie par ailleurs dans des villes modernisées (Chengdu, Ningbo, Guangzhou, Wuhan etc.). Elle vise à tisser des partenariats et des coopérations avec l’étranger, pour changer son image de pays-pilleur de propriété intellectuelle et de technologies.\nOr les nouvelles règles chinoises exigent des entreprises étrangères un transfert de technologies systématique en échange de l’accès au marché chinois, dans l'optique de développer l'industrie nationale.\nCôté américain, Steven Mnuchin, ex-Goldman Sachs, actuel secrétaire au Trésor, soutien de Donald Trump et principal négociateur avec Pékin, temporise pourtant en déclarant que s'il y avait « [des possibilités de guerre commerciale avec la Chine, …) ce n’était pas l’objectif ».\nLes risques d’une escalade seraient en effets trop importants pour ces deux économies si dépendantes l'une de l'autre. Les grandes entreprises américaines ont bien trop besoin de l’assemblage et de la fabrication chinoise. Ce marché représente ainsi environ 20 % du chiffre d’affaires d’Apple, 13 % du chiffre d’affaires de Boeing, 65 % pour Qualcomm ou encore 44 % pour Texas Instrument.\nL'autre atout de la Chine face aux États-Unis se situe sur une île.\nHainan (34,000 km², 10 millions d'habitants) anciennement rattachée à la province du Guangdong a été transformée il y a 30 ans en une vaste zone franche (zone économique spéciale). Elle est aujourd’hui au coeur de la nouvelle dynamique économique, financière et stratégique de Pékin.\nLe forum de Bo’ao, le « Davos chinois », à peine achevé (mi avril) a ainsi réitéré le besoin de faire de l’île une nouvelle zone d’investissement à destination des pays de l’Asie Pacifique dans le prolongement de l'ambitieuse route de la Soie, à l’intermédiaire entre Hong Kong et Singapour.\nFort d'un secteur des services modernisé, dont le chiffres d'affaire s'élève à 71 milliards de dollars en 2017, l'île va bénéficier d'investissements importants dans le secteur portuaire, immobilier et touristique (59 pays seront exemptés de visa).\nHainan se veut être une Hawaii asiatique en misant sur ses paysages, ses plages de sables et une ouverture sur la mer de Chine du méridionale.\nLa modernisation de l'île, son internationalisation et sa position stratégique montre ainsi que Pékin s’approprie le concept « indopacifique  » plutôt américain et prend pied dans une zone courtisée par les quatre grandes démocraties de l’architecture régionale du « Quad » (Quadrilateral Defence Coordination Group) (Japon, Inde, Australie et États-Unis).\nCe groupe - qui vise à une coordination des efforts de sécurité dans la zone- tente par ailleurs de limiter la montée en puissance de la Chine en Asie-Pacifique.\nMais les tentatives semblent frêles et vaines face par exemple au récent déploiement de l’armada chinoise (48 navires) en mer de Chine du Sud, zone hautement contestée à l'international et en particulier par les États-Unis.\nRead more: Why is the South China Sea so important to the US?\nPar ailleurs, Xi Jinping continue de titiller Trump. Il a ainsi récemment devancé l'entrevue du président américain avec Kim Jong-Un, le dirigeant nord-coréen, en invitant ce dernier à Pékin.\nMalgré une escalade complexe la crise pourrait cependant s’achever par des concessions réciproques.\nD'une part, les menaces, tensions et blocages américains s'avèrent inefficaces (dégradation du climat des affaires) et n'empêche pas la stratégie d’internationalisation de la monnaie chinoise.\nD'autres part des négociations discrètes avec les États-Unis comme récemment sur l’achat de semi-conducteurs américains et l’abaissement des droits de douane pourraient peu à peu confirmer le leadership chinois et finir d'évincer complètement l'UE de négociations qu'elle subit des deux rives d’un Pacifique lointain.\nScience at the Shine Dome — Acton, Australian Capital Territory\nForever Young: how can we age without getting older? — Wodonga, Victoria\nThe Vivid World of Virtual Reality — Sydney, New South Wales\nSydney Ideas: Sydney Asian Art Series - Ajay Sinha — Sydney, New South Wales\nSydney Ideas: Indigenous sustainability, practices and processes — Sydney, New South Wales\nCopyright © 2010–2018, The Conversation Media Group Ltd\n"}

The facilities, one of which could well be in Hainan, would have greater autonomy, more economic freedom and provide easier access to China’s markets for foreign companies, according to earlier reports.\nThe tit-for-tat trade dispute between China and the US is showing no signs of stopping. On Thursday, Washington threatened to impose hefty tariffs on a further US$50 billion worth of goods it imports from China, while Beijing hit back by saying it would protect its interests “at any cost”.\nIn a tweet on Monday, US President Donald Trump described its trading relationship with China as “stupid”.\n“When a car is sent to the United States from China, there is a Tariff to be paid of 2 1/2%. When a car is sent to China from the United States, there is a Tariff to be paid of 25%. Does that sound like free or fair trade. No, it sounds like STUPID TRADE – going on for years!”\nWhen a car is sent to the United States from China, there is a Tariff to be paid of 2 1/2%. When a car is sent to China from the United States, there is a Tariff to be paid of 25%. Does that sound like free or fair trade. No, it sounds like STUPID TRADE - going on for years!\n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 9, 2018\nZhou Wenzhong, general secretary of the Boao Forum said that at a time when globalisation was facing great challenges, the event provided an opportunity for academics, businesspeople and politicians to exchange opinions and expertise.\n“We hope those taking part will take back the consensus [reached] to their countries, and [use it to] influence their governments and policies,” he said.\nUS and China must step back from brink of trade war, says Dutch Prime Minister\nChina’s leaders were keen to promote the nation’s free-trade agenda even before the conference got under way.\nOn Sunday, China’s Foreign Minister Wang Yi met his Singaporean counterpart, Vivian Balakrishnan, in Beijing. The two men committed to increasing cooperation in the fight against protectionism and maintaining the global trading system with the World Trade Organisation at its core.\nMeanwhile, China’s Vice-President Wang Qishan told Singapore’s Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong that the two countries were “old friends” and that cooperation between them had a “strategic value”.\nLin Guijun, vice-president of the University of International Business and Economics in Beijing, said the Boao Forum would provide an opportunity for Beijing to send a message to the world amid the backdrop of rising protectionism.\n“China should make clear its position and make a contribution to global growth,” he said.\n\nChina should look beyond US Treasuries for ‘real assets’, central bank adviser says\nBut Christopher Balding, an associate professor of business and economics at the HSBC Business School in the south China city of Shenzhen, was less optimistic, saying that previous events showed that while many things were discussed in Hainan, few concrete changes ever came out of it.\n“Basically everything China does every year gets a little more attention, and because of all the trade tension this year it is getting even more attention,” he said.\n“[Xi] wants to say that China is very open, ready for investments, but at the same time he is basically going to say that we are not going to change anything or do anything different for the US. If you look at a lot of these speeches over time they are pretty much the same.”\nThough even that might be enough for Beijing to win some support, he said.\n“It won’t surprise anyone if [people leave] saying that China is more open, but that is clearly just the effect of the propaganda.”\nYou are signed up.

{"title": "Post-Davos depression", "author": "EJ Insight", "pub_time": "2018年2月1日", "url": "http://www.ejinsight.com/20180202-post-davos-depression/", "content": "I’ve been attending the World Economic Forum’s annual conference in Davos, Switzerland – where the so-called global elite convenes to discuss the world’s problems – since 1995. Never have I come away more dispirited than I have this year.\nThe world is plagued by almost intractable problems. Inequality is surging, especially in the advanced economies. The digital revolution, despite its potential, also carries serious risks for privacy, security, jobs, and democracy – challenges that are compounded by the rising monopoly power of a few American and Chinese data giants, including Facebook and Google. Climate change amounts to an existential threat to the entire global economy as we know it.\nPerhaps more disheartening than such problems, however, are the responses. To be sure, here at Davos, CEOs from around the world begin most of their speeches by affirming the importance of values. Their activities, they proclaim, are aimed not just at maximizing profits for shareholders, but also at creating a better future for their workers, the communities in which they work, and the world more generally. They may even pay lip service to the risks posed by climate change and inequality.\nBut, by the end of their speeches this year, any remaining illusion about the values motivating Davos CEOs was shattered. The risk that these CEOs seemed most concerned about is the populist backlash against the kind of globalization that they have shaped – and from which they have benefited immensely.\nNot surprisingly, these economic elites barely grasp the extent to which this system has failed large swaths of the population in Europe and the United States, leaving most households’ real incomes stagnant and causing labor’s share of income to decline substantially. In the US, life expectancy has declined for the second year in a row; among those with only a high school education, the decline has been underway for much longer.\nNot one of the US CEOs whose speech I heard (or heard about) mentioned the bigotry, misogyny, or racism of US President Donald Trump, who was present at the event. Not one mentioned the relentless stream of ignorant statements, outright lies, and impetuous actions that have eroded the standing of the US president – and thus of the US – in the world. None mentioned the abandonment of systems for ascertaining truth, and of truth itself.\nIndeed, none of America’s corporate titans mentioned the administration’s reductions in funding for science, so important for strengthening the US economy’s comparative advantage and supporting gains in Americans’ standard of living. None mentioned the Trump administration’s rejection of international institutions, either, or the attacks on the domestic media and judiciary – which amounts to an assault on the system of checks and balances that underpins US democracy.\nNo, the CEOs at Davos were licking their lips at the tax legislation that Trump and congressional Republicans recently pushed through, which will deliver hundreds of billions of dollars to large corporations and the wealthy people who own and run them – people like Trump himself. They are unperturbed by the fact that the same legislation will, when it is fully implemented, lead to an increase in taxes for the majority of the middle class – a group whose fortunes have been in decline for the last 30 years or so.\nEven in their narrowly materialistic world, where growth matters above all else, the Trump tax legislation should not be celebrated. After all, it lowers taxes on real-estate speculation – an activity that has produced sustainable prosperity nowhere, but has contributed to rising inequality everywhere.\nThe legislation also imposes a tax on universities like Harvard and Princeton – sources of numerous important ideas and innovations – and will lead to lower local-level public expenditure in parts of the country that have thrived, precisely because they have made public investments in education and infrastructure. The Trump administration is clearly willing to ignore the obvious fact that, in the twenty-first century, success actually demands more investment in education.\nFor the CEOs of Davos, it seems that tax cuts for the rich and their corporations, along with deregulation, is the answer to every country’s problems. Trickle-down economics, they claim, will ensure that, ultimately, the entire population benefits economically. And the CEOs’ good hearts are apparently all that is needed to ensure that the environment is protected, even without relevant regulations.\nYet the lessons of history are clear. Trickle-down economics doesn’t work. And one of the key reasons why our environment is in such a precarious condition is that corporations have not, on their own, lived up to their social responsibilities. Without effective regulations and a real price to pay for polluting, there is no reason whatsoever to believe that they will behave differently than they have.\nThe Davos CEOs were euphoric about the return to growth, about their soaring profits and compensation. Economists reminded them that this growth is not sustainable, and has never been inclusive. But such arguments have little impact in a world where materialism is king.\nSo forget the platitudes about values that CEOs recite in the opening paragraphs of their speeches. They may lack the candor of Michael Douglas’s character in the 1987 movie Wall Street, but the message hasn’t changed: “Greed is good.” What depresses me is that, though the message is obviously false, so many in power believe it to be true.\nCopyright: Project Syndicate\n– Contact us at [email protected]\nRC\n\n"}

There are literally dozens of panels on the topic scattered around this snow-buried village, as my colleague Adam Lashinsky reported yesterday. There seems to be no-one here who questions the notion that vast amounts of data combined with powerful machine-learning algorithms will not only transform almost every business, but also the way we live.\nBut while the promise of AI is widely accepted, the practice remains fairly limited. Martin Reeves of BCG reported that his firm, working with MIT, surveyed more than 3,000 companies last year and found that while 85% of them believed AI would become a competitive advantage in the future, only a quarter were implementing it now, and only 5% were implementing it extensively. On the same panel, Renault-Nissan CEO Carlos Ghosn said adapting products to the unprecedented pace of innovation has become the top job of every CEO.\nAt a separate event, investor and former Google executive Kai Fu Lee confirmed what we reported from Guangzhou last December—that China may soon pass the U.S. in developing AI technology. He cited four reasons:\nLater today, I’ll be moderating a panel on rising trade tensions that will include Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, WTO head Roberto Acevedo, Cargill CEO David MacLennan, Standard Charter CEO Bill Winter, and Eni Chairman Emma Marcegaglia. The session, certain to produce some fireworks, will be webcast on Fortune.com.\nMore news below.\nHuge Qualcomm Fine\nThe European Commission has hit chip firm Qualcomm with a $1.23 billion antitrust fine for illegally paying Apple billions to make sure that only Qualcomm’s LTE baseband processors were used in iPhones and iPads between 2011 and 2016. The fine represents 4.9% of Qualcomm’s 2017 turnover. The main victim of the secret arrangement was Intel. Fortune\nToys “R” Us Slims Down\nToys “R” Us will shut down around a fifth of its U.S. stores as it tries to claw its way out of bankruptcy. The closure of around 180 stores will begin in early February. The bricks-and-mortar retail chain is, like many others, struggling as online sales gain in popularity. Fortune\nWhite House Sour on Immigration Deal\nThe White House considers the bipartisan Senate proposal for fixing immigration—a bill that would legalize so-called “Dreamers”—to be “totally unacceptable,” it said Tuesday. “To my friends at the White House, you’ve been all over the board, you haven’t been a reliable partner and the Senate is going to move,” said Senator Lindsey Graham. Wall Street Journal\nSenate Approves Powell\nThe U.S. Senate has confirmed Jerome Powell as the next chair of the Federal Reserve, by a whopping 84 votes to 13. Powell, currently a governor of the central bank, is a lawyer rather than an economist by training, and he will need to figure out how to deal with the Trump administrations deregulatory push. Fortune\nGlobal Debt Threat\nYesterday’s CEO Daily highlighted current economic optimism, but J.P. Morgan’s international chairman, Jacob Frenkel, has warned business and political leaders not to forget the problem of excessive global debt, which he said was the most pressing concern for the global economy. CNBC\nOil Peak Looms\nGlobal demand for oil may peak in a decade’s time, according to internal Shell studies.

At Davos, mavericks ...", "author": "South China Morning Post", "pub_time": "2018年1月24日", "url": "http://www.scmp.com/news/world/united-states-canada/article/2130544/how-should-we-measure-countrys-economies-davos", "content": "\nWorld Economic Forum\nDeveloped in 1934 by economist Simon Kuznets to help the United States chart an escape from the Great Depression, GDP measures the total value of a country’s goods and services over quarters and years\nComments:\n\nIt can topple governments, confer international bragging rights and pretty much obsessed the government of China once the country began its long march back to economic prowess.\nBut is GDP (gross domestic product) outliving its usefulness as a metric of economic size, and is it stoking social and environmental crisis by encouraging growth at any cost?\nDebate about whether it is time to adopt a more nuanced calculator has grown louder in recent years, and featured anew during discussions at the World Economic Forum (WEF) in Davos this week.\n“There’s emerging agreement that the kind of statistics we’ve used in the past just aren’t working any more,” said British economist Diane Coyle, from the University of Manchester, in Davos.\nCoyle is one of several experts who have written books on the subject. Others have detailed proposals such as a “Human Development Index”, and a new addition to the literature has been published this week from Financial Times journalist David Pilling, entitled The Growth Delusion.\nIn Davos, Coyle outlined new thinking that would supplement brute economic data with measurements covering human capital (skills and education), physical infrastructure and “intangible capital” such as computerised data and patents. They would also cover environmental quality, and “social capital” looking at how united or divided a country is.\nAscribing a value to data is particularly pressing as companies and customers increasingly transact their lives “in the cloud”. To take one example, a globally accessible and hugely useful resource like Wikipedia is worth precisely zero in traditional GDP accounting models.\nNeither does GDP encompass the black market, omitting a huge source of activity and income in many developing countries, including Africa and Latin America.\nNotably, GDP cannot measure the distribution of wealth within a country. So while its total value can go up, gains are all too often skewed towards top earners. Those lower down the ladder can fall further behind in relative terms.\nThat is exactly what has been playing out in the United States, powering a populist backlash that elected Donald Trump, and influencing the British people’s decision to quit the European Union.\nAfter the Brexit referendum campaign, pro-EU campaigner Anand Menon wrote he was trying to explain at one event about the hit to GDP he felt would come if Britons voted to leave the bloc.\nChina’s leaders are too obsessed with the GDP growth rate, says S&P chief economist\nHe said one woman in the audience in Newcastle, northern England, shouted back “that’s your bloody GDP, not ours”.\nDeveloped in 1934 by economist Simon Kuznets to help the United States chart an escape from the Great Depression, GDP measures the total value of a country’s goods and services over quarters and years.\nWoe betide a government that heads into an election on the back of a recession – usually defined as two consecutive quarters of decline in its GDP.\nBut even where there is growth, disenchantment with how it is shared out can be seen vividly in Brexit-bound Britain, according to Inga Beale, chief executive of Lloyd’s of London, the insurance market.\n\n“We’ve got to find another mechanism to include much bigger parts of the population, and use different metrics to measure success of a country,” she told CNBC television.\nGDP is widely seen as a blunt instrument to measure growth, and has attracted criticism from Nobel Prize winners Joseph Stiglitz and Amartya Sen, and International Monetary Fund chief Christine Lagarde, among others.\nBut countries that do execute sustained rises in GDP can use the accreted wealth to transform their standing.\nExhibit A is China, which after decades of pell-mell growth is now the world’s second-biggest economy as measured by GDP, awarding it the kind of international prestige and influence it has not enjoyed for centuries.\nBut even in China the GDP debate is intensifying as President Xi Jinping attempts to prioritise quality over quantity in the economy’s expansion.\nSo what are the alternatives to GDP?\nDissident thinkers are calling for a holistic approach that calibrates not just economic inputs but human capital along with quality-of-life issues.\nWith the planet warming and some resources already exploited to near exhaustion, including many fisheries, the WEF proposed a broader measure of growth called the Inclusive Development Index that accounts for such factors.\nThe 2018 index assessed 103 economies by measuring three individual pillars – growth and development, inclusion, and intergenerational equity. On that basis, Norway is the world’s richest country and the rest of the top 10 comprises small European countries and Australia. Germany is in 12th position, the United States is 23rd and China 26th.\n“Decades of prioritising economic growth over social equity has led to historically high levels of wealth and income inequality,” the WEF said in a report. “[That’s] caused governments to miss out on a virtuous circle in which growth is strengthened by being shared more widely and generated without unduly straining the environment or burdening future generations.”\n\nThe WEF report showed that while advanced economies grew GDP by 5.3 per cent, on average, between 2012 and 2016, inclusion grew only by 0.01 per cent.\n“Under-emphasis of these [structural] policies relative to macroeconomic, trade and financial stability policies is a key reason for many governments’ failure in recent decades to mobilise a more effective response to widening inequality and stagnating median income as technological change and globalisation have gathered force,” the report said.\nOverall, the findings largely make for bleak reading. Over the past five years, despite a growing world economy, social inclusion has fallen or been unchanged in 20 of 29 advanced economies and intergenerational equity has worsened in 56 of 74 emerging economies, according to the report.\nChina’s new economy grows twice as fast as GDP and helps offset job losses, says top think tank\nOver the same period, less than half of the advanced economies were successful in reducing poverty and only eight recorded a decrease in income inequality.\nWEF argued that using GDP as a primary economic metric is ineffective as it measures current production of goods and services rather than the extent to which the economy contributes to broader socio-economic progress as seen in median household income, employment opportunity, economic security and quality of life.\nIn any case, Professor Coyle said, countries do not drastically have to overhaul their national accounting to take stock of environmental degradation caused by the rush for growth.\n“You just need to breathe the air in Beijing to feel the cost,” she said.\nAdditional reporting by Bloomberg\nYou are signed up.

{"title": "US Tariffs, Aimed at China and South Korea, to Hit Targets Worldwide", "author": "New York Times", "pub_time": "2018年1月23日", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/23/business/trump-china-tariffs-trade.html", "content": "Advertisement\nSupported by\nBy Keith Bradsher and Sui-Lee Wee\nDAVOS, Switzerland — When the Trump administration unveiled tariffs on imports of solar panels and washing machines — industries dominated by Chinese and South Korean businesses — they deliberately applied them to products from around the world.\nThe move on Monday, in the eyes of United States trade officials, reflected the complexities of modern global trade. Though companies from just two countries account for the majority of both sectors, those firms have set up factories in multiple locations across national borders.\nAs a result, the tariffs will affect factories and workers in a variety of countries, reflecting the globalized supply chains and byzantine corporate ownership structures that are at the heart of many ubiquitous products.\nThe administration’s decision was followed on Tuesday by the announcement that a group of 11 countries would resurrect the Trans-Pacific Partnership, the pact that Mr. Trump pulled out of a year ago. The agreement, expected to be signed later this year, further complicates the president’s trade policies.\nThe solar panel case in particular has been a case study in the complexity of global trade. Suniva, one of the American solar companies that had sought the tariffs, filed for bankruptcy protection last year, citing the effects of Chinese imports. But the majority owner of Suniva is itself Chinese, and the company’s American bankruptcy trustee supported the trade litigation over the objections of the Chinese owners.\nHere is a rundown of the wide-ranging impact the new tariffs may have.\nPossibly — but not without costs for all the countries involved.\nChina and South Korea could take their complaints to the World Trade Organization, which arbitrates international trade disputes.\nIf the W.T.O. sided with those countries, the United States would be under considerable pressure to back down. If it did not, there would be two major sets of consequences. For one, the World Trade Organization could greenlight other countries’ setting similar trade limits. More broadly, it would raise the question of whether the United States accepts the organization’s decisions — Robert E. Lighthizer, the United States trade representative, has argued for years that such decisions should, essentially, be advisory.\nThe United States market has long been very attractive to foreign companies, and not just for its large and affluent set of consumers. Its tariffs on imports are much lower than those of most other countries, and it also has relatively low sales taxes. But President Trump has regularly questioned whether existing free trade agreements are in the best interests of the country, making it possible that such favorable terms may erode.\nStill, China and South Korea have leverage of their own. They are big importers of American-made machinery and agricultural products, and China, in particular, has long been a big buyer of soybeans and other crops from states that supported Mr. Trump in the 2016 election.\nIndeed, as an enormous consumer of all types of global goods, China could also easily punish American companies by opting to buy from international competitors. For instance, it could opt for Airbus planes over Boeing’s or crack down on General Motors while leaving Volkswagen alone.\nA trade fight would, however, be painful. Both China and South Korea export a lot more to the United States than they import, meaning higher tariffs could hit their economies harder.\nThe United States accuses China of swamping the market with artificially cheap, subsidized solar panels. But increasingly, those panels come from elsewhere. Steep tariffs imposed in 2012 on solar panels imported from China have made it cheaper for Chinese companies to assemble the panels in factories elsewhere before shipping them to the United States.\nCountries like Malaysia and South Korea now account for most of the United States’ solar imports, according to data from Global Trade Atlas, a database maintained by the research firm IHS Markit.\nChinese companies like JA Solar and JinkoSolar, for example, have opened factories in Malaysia, though most such businesses still do much of their research and development at home.\nThe broad manufacturing base means other countries may face job losses and other hardships in the face of the United States tariffs, which could galvanize opposition to the president’s action.\nAmerican companies also manufacture some of their panels in Southeast Asia before importing some of them back into the United States. But their products tend to use a different technology, known as thin-film solar panels, which are not covered by the latest tariffs.\nPresident Trump is set to speak to world leaders gathered this week at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, where he could drop hints of whether the United States has more trade barriers to announce.\nWashington could take action on aluminum or steel imports, two categories that have vexed previous presidential administrations. It is also exploring a major trade action against China focused on intellectual property.\n“China’s regulatory authorities do not allow U.S. companies to make their own decisions about technology transfer and the assignment or licensing of intellectual property rights,” Mr. Lighthizer’s office said as part of a broader report last week, suggesting possible strong action.\nThe Trump administration’s move nevertheless leaves room for negotiation.\nThe tariffs announced on Monday on solar panels were not as high as American companies had requested. And with washing machines, the tariffs were somewhat higher than requested, but the administration said the higher rate would not kick in until the United States imports 1.2 million washers. A lower charge will apply to any imports below that threshold.\nHe Weiwen, a former Chinese Commerce Ministry official who is now an influential trade policy researcher in Beijing, said Chinese policymakers had reacted with “strong dissatisfaction” to the tariffs. But he predicted that China’s response would at first be cautious, as officials wait to see how strong the other American actions will be.\n“We cannot expand to an overall trade war,” he added.\nFollow Keith Bradsher and Sui-Lee Wee on Twitter: @KeithBradsher and @suilee.\nKeith Bradsher reported from Davos, and Sui-Lee Wee from Guangzhou, China.\nOpinionThe Editorial Board\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nCollapse\nSEE MY OPTIONS\n"}

As for economic activity, 13.51 million new jobs were created in 2017, maintaining the record of more than 13 million for five consecutive years. The number of newly registered enterprises amounted to 6.07 million, up by 9.9%. Regarding economic structure, the dominance of the services industry became more prominent. The proportion of tertiary industry in GDP was 51.6% – 11.1 percentage points higher than that of secondary industry. The services industry contributed 58.8% to economic growth, an increase of 1.3 percentage points over the previous year. Consumption continued to be the driving force behind economic growth, totalling 58.8% – 26.7 percentage points higher than the gross capital formation.\nRegarding economic quality, energy consumption per RMB10,000 GDP dropped by 3.7% compared with 2016; and the author believes that most people will have personal experience of environmental improvement and more effective pollution control. The increase in residential consumption is apparent: the Engel coefficient was 29.3%, down 0.8 percentage points over the previous year. Per capita expenditure in 2017 was 11% on healthcare and 8.9% on education, culture and entertainment. With the further concentration on the ethos of ‘manufacturing, service plus internet’ and accelerated online and offline integration, high-end consumption began spreading further into middle-income groups.\nIn conclusion, the macroeconomy grew steadily in 2017, manifesting generally benign changes. Supply-side structural reform is gradually taking effect. Since the 18th National Congress of the Communist Party of China (CPC) in 2012, a roll-out of crucial reform measures has improved the efficiency of resource allocation, total factor productivity and advanced macroeconomic development. For instance, there was strong support for reforms prioritising the household registration system; the policy encouraging rural migrant populations to relocate to cities was fully implemented nationwide2; endowment and medical insurance were enacted in urban and rural areas3; and a unified fund was established to ensure resources for compulsory education in all regions.4\nChina also pushed ahead with market-based reform in the exchange and use of land: rural collective construction land will now, like urban land, enter the market under new land-use regulation5; rural rights on ownership, contract and management have been separated and the exchange of land has been enabled6; and agricultural product price reform7 has optimised the allocation of land use.\nChina has accelerated the pace of ‘opening‑up’ to the outside world by introducing a management model of pre-establishment national treatment with a negative list, in accordance with the principle that such a model can be copied and with the expectation that the model can be applied to other areas. It has also implemented a high-level trade and investment liberalisation facilitation policy to reduce import tariffs and cut trade barriers. China’s business reform focused on removing inappropriate administrative controls and drastically lowering the threshold for access to the free market. Meanwhile, China has implemented judicial reform: the Supreme Court set up six circuit courts to achieve full coverage and carry out more contracts; and trials in cross-regional civil litigation cases have been made fairer. In addition, China has set up intellectual property courts in Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou to strengthen the protection of property rights. All of these measures have markedly improved the business environment in China – it now ranks 78th out of 190 economies, 18 places higher than in 2013.8\nNo target for GDP growth was proposed at the 19th CPC National Congress, but China must continue to maintain an appropriate economic growth rate to turn the ‘two-step’ blueprint for development – China realising socialist modernisation by 2035, and becoming a modern, prosperous nation by the middle of the century – into a reality. Realism is required to maintain economic growth within the correct parameters and achieve high-quality development. China’s macro policy must focus on supply-side structural reform as there is only limited policy scope for implementing demand management in the coming period.\n1. Fiscal and monetary aggregate policies are limited. On the part of fiscal policy, there is little scope for large-scale, concentrated infrastructure development after so many previous rounds of stimulation. On the one hand, the local debt risks proliferate, and infrastructure debt should not be increased further. On the other, it is quite reasonable to carry out infrastructure development such as transportation in accordance with the principle of advancement. A balance should be struck: with the development of a metropolitan-centred urban belt and a people-oriented urbanisation process, ample and sustained latitude exists for economically viable investment in infrastructure.\nIn terms of monetary policy, China’s monetary multiplier has risen rapidly, from 3.86 in 2012 to 5.02 in 2016, while the ratio of M2 to GDP has increased from 180.3% to 208.3% over the same period,9 indicating rapid economic monetisation. The GDP growth rate has, however, been declining simultaneously, indicating that the expansion of the money supply is impacting less on the economy. To this end, stimulus through monetary policy will only aggravate over-monetisation and further amplify the shift from a real to a virtual economy while playing a limited role in stimulating economic growth.\n2. Greater latitude is needed for fiscal policy to focus on structural adjustment in line with supply-side structural reform. Tax relief can help enterprises increase investment in research and development (R&D), as well as enhance economic vitality through innovation. Efforts can be made to cut overcapacity in expenditure, reduce excess inventory, deleverage, lower costs and strengthen areas of weakness through readjustment of expenditure. Resources can also be guided to industries more in line with macro-control measures to improve the diversity and quality of supply. Fiscal policy has much to offer in these areas. Monetary policy, in principle, has all the attributes required without the need to adjust the structure. Against the backdrop of a ‘new normal’ in the economy, save for major external shocks or internal systemic risks, the adoption of monetary distortions similar to US monetary policy or European Central Bank structural policy instruments will be unnecessary. The European Union has a single currency, but no unified finance, so must adopt monetary policy tools to achieve structural adjustment.\n3. Supply-side structural reform should be problem-conscious and focused on long-term goals and dedicated effort. A report from the 19th CPC National Congress states that: “As China’s socialism with Chinese characteristics has entered a new era, the principal contradiction facing Chinese society has evolved. What China now faces is the contradiction between unbalanced and inadequate development and people’s ever-growing needs for a better life.” The report records the unwavering national reality that China is, and will in the long term remain, at the primary stage of socialism. Its international status as the largest developing country has not changed. Supply-side structural reform must, on the one hand, adapt to the change in social contradictions, be problem-aware and serve high-quality economic development; and, on the other hand, emphasise long-term goals and institution-building and continue to introduce reform measures to increase effectiveness year-on-year.\nChina’s economic development is still confronted by two deep-rooted contradictions. One is the reality that economic and social development cannot be advanced merely by will alone. The other is efficiency loss, caused by the distortion of institutional mechanisms, which can be corrected through reforms that aim to improve the efficiency of resource allocation and further boost economic growth.\nWith regard to objective reality, improvements can be made in advancing economic and social development with the aid of supply-side structural reform, but fundamental change is not possible. For example, China has experienced a decrease in its workforce since 2015, and this trend is accelerating. In 2017, the working population aged between 16 and 59 years was 902 million, a decrease of 5.48 million on the previous year. The population over the age of 60 years reached 241 million, an increase of 10 million on 2016, and accounts for 17.3% of the total population.10 The two-child policy, introduced in 2015, has helped increase the population and the supply of future labour, but the recent drop in labour force participation has become a risk factor and has made the future unpredictable.\nChina has stepped up efforts in environmental protection and pollution control to meet the public’s need for a better life. But there may be some trade-off, as development that caused increased pollution also resulted in GDP growth. In addition, the external environment is tumultuous – trade protectionism is on the rise. Supply-side structural reform must be concentrated on improving the identification of problems or making appropriate delays. China must, while boosting high-quality economic development, avoid major fluctuations and maintain growth.\nSupply-side structural reform must contend with the distortion of institutional mechanisms and prioritise the following\nfive aspects:\n1. Promoting the free flow of factors. The pace of urbanisation has accelerated; the reform of the household registration system has been comprehensively carried out; rural land transfer has been piloted; market-orientated allocation of land-use patterns has also made remarkable progress; some inefficient planting areas have been gradually withdrawn, and thus the agricultural production structure has been improved. The area allocated for the production of maize, with a high inventory in 2017, was reduced by 3.6%, while the allocated area for bean sowing was increased by 6.7%.12\nMany obstacles stand in the way of the free flow of factors. Labour mobility, restricting people’s ability to obtain cars and houses and enrol in higher education, through permanent resident permits, is still relatively common in some cities, which is not only a hindrance to the free movement of workers, but also to the improvement of income distribution as, according to the theory of development economics, the transfer of citizens living in agricultural regions to non-agricultural sectors improves income distribution. China’s Gini coefficient was 0.467 in 2017, having risen for two consecutive years. Although this magnitude is small, it highlights that, despite accelerated urbanisation, barriers to the free flow of population widens the gap in income distribution. Efforts must be made to remove all benefits attached to household registration, advancing ‘equal rights for tenants and homeowners’,11 providing both with access to basic public services and promoting the free movement of the labour force. This will help improve total factor productivity, advance income distribution and reduce labour costs.\n2. Streamlining administration and cutting taxes and administrative fees. Since the 18th CPC National Congress, strenuous efforts have been made towards reforming business, streamlining administration and delegating government powers. The next step is to reinforce institutional reform. In terms of tax cuts, annual revenue for 2017 was RMB17.3 trillion, an increase of 7.4%. This growth rate shows the effectiveness of tax cuts – if fiscal revenue is synchronised with a nominal GDP growth rate of 10.5% (6.9% plus 3.6% deflator), the fiscal revenue for the full year should be RMB17.8 trillion, and the RMB500 billion increase on actual income shows the effects of tax relief. Given better connectivity between fiscal income and the producer price index (PPI), estimated tax cuts would be even greater if calculated with 6.3% of PPI in 2016.12 This highlights the obvious effect of China’s tax reduction. In 2017, raw material prices rose by more than 8%, PPI by 6.3% and consumer price index by 1.6%, indicating that pressure is moving to the middle- and low-income groups. More taxes apply to high-income groups, but a limited adjustment to income distribution is effected. Further analysis reveals that there remains scope for additional tax cuts: the push for income tax reform, increasing deductions from corporate income tax in R&D, transferring personal income tax to comprehensive collection, reducing the tax burden on low-income groups, avoiding personal tax’s evolution into payroll tax, and forming reverse regulation. Additionally, administrative fee cuts and charges for non-administrative licensing projects lacking a statutory legal basis of the higher authorities have been cleared at central government level. However, a persistently large number of fee-charging items not covered by local government laws should now be the focus of the next step toward lowering costs.\n3. Enhancing protection on private investment. Since 2010, China’s consumption has exceeded its investment. It is widely believed that economic growth has reached a turning point towards being primarily driven by consumption and supplemented by investment. In fact, investment – especially private investment – still has great potential for growth. Internationally, both Japan and the Republic of Korea have experienced high investment and high growth for a significant amount of time. Domestically, despite the rapid increase of resident leverage in recent years, the upturn in residents’ disposable income is still higher than that of consumption, which means savings are still rising. Eventually, residents’ leverage ratios will steadily decline, and the savings rate can be maintained at a certain level, which can lay a foundation for substantial investment growth. Moving forward, under the context of a limited space for concentrated governmental investment, China will focus on strengthening the effective protection of property rights and contracts and improving legal justice to provide a guaranteed external environment for the survival and development of enterprises – especially privately-owned enterprises – and fully mobilise the enthusiasm for private investment.\n4. Continuing opening‑up to the outside world and advocating globalisation. China will firmly safeguard multilateralism, support the multilateral trade system, oppose various kinds of protectionism and build an open world economy. It will strengthen its involvement with international economic and trade rules, implement more active import policies, ease market access in the financial services industry and continue to expand market access in other fields. China will establish international advanced rules as the standard, give free-trade zones greater reform autonomy and improve their quality. Based on the lessons of free-trade zone pilots, China will implement pre-established national treatment with negative lists to create a fair, transparent and predictable market environment under the rule of law. If the flow of elements, the streamlining of administration and delegation of powers, the protection of private investment, and the continued and reinforced opening‑up are in place, the business environment in China will further improve. There is also reason to believe that the economic growth in the next period will be maintained at a high level of greater than 6%.\n5. Preventing and resolving financial risks. Failure to achieve this could lead to subversive consequences. Currently, the ratio of M2 to GDP in China exceeds 200% – roughly equal to that of Japan and more than double the US’s 91%. However, the average one-month Shanghai Interbank Offer Rate (Shibor) in 2017 in China was 4.09%. In the same period, the comparable interest rate in Japan was –0.01%, and that of the US was 1.1%.13 China’s monetary environment is more relaxed while the cost of capital is even higher, indicating a serious distortion of the financial system. Overmixed operation – ‘comprehensive management’ – has caused financial chaos; there is a wide variety of derivatives with Chinese characteristics: peer, channel, nesting, capital pool, universal insurance of Ponzi financing, peer-to-peer, non-standard and payday loans superimpose on one other, resulting in the cost of capital constantly rising and the real economy becoming exacerbated. Simultaneously,  channels of risk transmission are extremely opaque. Compared with the US financial market a decade ago – where the characteristics of risk and reward for various derivatives, such as mortgaged-backed securities (MBSs) and collateral debt obligations, were not fully understood although they are now fully recorded – China is even more chaotic and needs to scrutinise the underlyings of the products to identify the true risks and benefits. In addition to conventional banking, securities, insurance and funds, new and innovative financial and quasi-financial institutions with Chinese characteristics and regional exchange markets have been created. In this way, it is very likely that there are systemic financial risks in China. The immediate task is now to win the battle of risk prevention and control.\n\nChina can overcome this difficult challenge with hard work. First, senior leaders must understand the situation. President Xi Jinping advised at the 2015 Economic Work Conference that China “must step up the special rectification of financial risks and resolutely reject systematic regional risks”. Taking the US scenario a decade ago as an example, Hank Paulson, former US Treasury secretary, explained to the author that shortly after he had taken office in 2006 he felt financial risks were swirling like a brewing storm, but there was no consensus in society and no means of preventing the outbreak of risks.\nSecond is an understanding of the situation by governments and financial institutions. Following President Xi’s instructions, governments, and regulatory agencies in particular, have already taken actions to request the return of assets, tighten their trade contracts and strictly control disguised bonds issued by local governments. Financial institutions are also stepping up their efforts to control risks. This highlights that society has recognised the occurrence of a ‘grey rhino’ incident. At that time, there was no consensus in the US financial community except for warnings from a handful of people such as Paulson, economist Ben Bernanke and former president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and Secretary of the Treasury Tim Geithner. At that time, the grey rhino was merely a possibility and there was no expectation that the grey rhino would turn into a ‘black swan’. Crisis accumulation is competing with consensus on remediation formation – the former has been running in front, and there was no remediation of chaos or consensus on rescuing a systematic outbreak of risk until the downfall of Lehman Brothers and the emergence of black swan incidents.\nThird, awareness of the key risks is essential. President Xi once said: “We must not forget that housing is for living in, not for speculation”, and “Finance should return to its origin and serve the real economy”. This emphasises that the major risk points are financialised real estate and unanchored finance. Before the outbreak of the financial crisis in the US, the American Dream of owning a home was embraced by all US citizens, regardless of how implausible it was to achieve. Financial markets were subsequently flooded with MBSs, with mortgages as underlying assets and derivatives. Eventually, these became intertwined, giving rise to risks.\nFourth, the overall environment must be considered. After the outbreak of the financial crisis, the Group of 20 summit and a series of financial channel meetings saved the global economy with joint efforts, and aided the prompt formation of consensus on strengthening financial supervision and helped to roll out concrete measures. There is reason for confidence, as China’s supervision of major financial institutions is now effectively in line with international standards, and major financial institutions are relatively healthy. In the US, where the environment was not so good when the crisis broke out, risks were concentrated in seven major financial institutions.\nThe comparison drawn between the US and China during the financial crisis offers a number of lessons – many of which are unique to China. These include the proliferation of transactional derivatives with Chinese characteristics, and the establishment of new and innovative financial and quasi-financial institutions and regional exchange markets with Chinese features, as well as difficulty in regulation. Combating financial risks is a long-term prospect, as Liu He, vice premier of the People’s Republic of China, said earlier this year at the World Economic Forum Annual Meeting in Davos: “We will strive to win the battle against financial risks in the next three years or so.”14 If the problem can be resolved in around three years, so too can the problem of high nominal interest rates.\nFifth, China’s introspection towards its future financial model must be considered. It is interesting that China is a global financial market, while mixed operations are rapidly developing with high risks. In the past, some local leaders have been keen on developing local trading markets, but found it too difficult to exercise regulation. Risks in regional markets will inevitably face spillovers that can be very tricky to handle, which is why these leaders are carefully reviewing these issues.\nAs making qualitative judgements on future patterns becomes increasingly challenging, the author posits the following:\nPresident Xi emphasised that “finance should return to its origin and serve the real economy”. Should we adhere to the mode of mixed operation to have finance return to its origins? Are we capable of confronting complicated challenges on financial regulation brought by mixed operations? Is it necessary for financial institutions to bear high compliance costs once mixed supervision is implemented? Is it necessary for the real economy to pay excessive nominal interests? Is this due to high compliance cost spillovers or high-risk pricing brought by overmixed operation or multiple derivatives. In the 1990s, then-Premier of China Zhu Rongji insisted on separate management, knowing that mixed operation was destined to fail at that particular stage, as citizens were neither well disciplined nor law-abiding enough, and institutions lacked the capabilities of regulation.\nUnder his insistence, The segregation supervision pattern of the China Banking Regulatory Commission, the China Securities Regulatory Commission and the China Insurance Regulatory Commission was established, meaning financial institutions would be split according to their main businesses.15\nIn January 2010 – in the wake of the financial crisis – Nobel Prize winner and economist Paul Krugman wrote: “The US must learn from its neighbour, Canada. More specifically, Canada places more stringent restrictions on the leverage of the banking sector and limits the securitisation process. These constraints in Canada in recent years, undoubtedly, have made bankers lose many opportunities to come up with so-called clever ideas, but these restrictions have all proved to be correct.”16 Observations of financial markets worldwide often find that those in Canada are considered the most ‘boring’  as financial authorities strictly regulate and control mixed operation, limit the appearance and trading of derivatives, prevent infection of financial risks and make every effort to enable financial consumers to achieve the co-ordinated development of finance with the real economy. However, even after the global financial crisis, Canada’s banking system was still rated by Standard & Poor’s and the International Monetary Fund as the healthiest banking system in the world. Its experience therefore deserves our attention and reflection.\nThe report of the 19th CPC National Congress reminds us that the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation can by no means be easily achieved and the endeavour to accomplish the two centenary goals will not always be smooth. President Xi’s remarks in January 2018 implore China to ramp up its vigilance towards danger and perservere in preventing risks.\nAs long as China conscientiously implements the spirit of the 19th CPC National Congress, persists in deepening supply-side structural reform and resolutely guards against risks and challenges – particularly keeping away from global risks that may delay or interrupt the great rejuvenation process and high-quality economic development – we will certainly be able to fulfil the Chinese Dream of rejuvenating the Chinese nation.\n\nNotes\n1.

No, it sounds like STUPID TRADE – going on for years!” tweeted Trump.\nThe US has threatened to levy tariffs of up to US$150 billion worth on Chinese imports, complaining of unfair Chinese trade practices, including restrictions on market access and the alleged theft of intellectual property. Beijing responded with a list of American goods likely to face import tariffs as the trade dispute escalates.\nXi, however, told the audience in Hainan that the world has become the “Earth village” and it would go against historical trends to close up, suggesting that China did not want to engage in a trade war with the US or escalate trade tensions into a broader confrontation, at least not for now.\nChina “sincerely” hoped to buy more from foreign countries to satisfy domestic demand, he said.\nChina’s President Xi Jinping reveals economic plans at Boao Forum amid trade tensions with the US\nThe bulk of Xi’s speech at the event attended by regional political and business leaders, and promoted as Asia’s answer to the World Economic Forum in Davos, was about his vision for China’s place in the world order, trying to sooth worries about nation’s rise and stressing its emphasis on peaceful development.\n“We will never threaten anyone, nor overthrow the existing international system” no matter how rich or powerful China becomes, said Xi, who has become the most powerful Chinese leader since Mao Zedong.\n“We will not seek to build up spheres of influence – China will always be a builder for world peace, a contributor to global development and a defender of international order,” he said.\n\nXi did not name the United States or Trump in his speech, but he made clear that China supported a multilateral trade system and is against a “cold war mentality” or “zero-sum game”.\n“Being overbearing or isolationist can only hit walls,” Xi said. “Only by adhering to peaceful development and working hand in hand can we truly achieve multi-win and win-win results.”\nXi said China would proactively develop global partnerships and “firmly support multilateralism” for the sake of the “a community of common destiny” for all people, a phrase Xi favours to describe his future global vision.\nWho will be the winners and losers in a China-US trade war?\nThat vision was met with delight by Trump on Tuesday, as he tweeted: “Very thankful for President Xi of China’s kind words on tariffs and automobile barriers...also, his enlightenment on intellectual property and technology transfers. We will make great progress together!”\nThis is not the first time Beijing has pledged to further open up its economy amid criticism from foreign firms about the barriers to operating in China.\nXi delivered a speech at Davos last year soon after Trump took office, positioning himself as a champion of free trade and globalisation.\nVery thankful for President Xi of China’s kind words on tariffs and automobile barriers...also, his enlightenment on intellectual property and technology transfers. We will make great progress together!\n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 10, 2018\nSceptics, however, have questioned whether China’s government is genuinely committed to further opening up its economy.\nFor example, the “Made in China 2025” government-backed initiative to help secure a Chinese advantages in hi-tech industries such as robotics and electric vehicles, has created unease among other countries.\nTrump softens on China as Beijing ramps up rhetoric in show of toughness over trade spat\nXi tried to address these concerns on Tuesday, saying China would be serious about protecting intellectual property rights and will tweak its domestic regulations to comply with international economic and trade rules.\nMichael Clauss, the German ambassador to China, wrote in a note commenting on Xi’s speech that “promises to open up further have not been in short supply” but rhetoric alone would not change the fact that China was still extensively restricting foreign investment.\n“We hope this time we will actually see some meaningful implementation,” he said.\nChina’s forex reserves are up – and so are fears of a US trade war hit\nSingaporean Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said after Xi’s speech that he hoped China and the US would be able to work out a solution and keep from further escalation in their trade disputes.\n\n“A trade war between China and the US is still far from inevitable, but if one does happen it will undermine the multilateral trading system, which has underpinned global prosperity,” he said.\n“What is ultimately at stake is war and peace, the security and stability of the world.”\nThe message from Xi may help to cool trade tensions between China and the US.\nRobert Koopman, the chief economist at the World Trade Organisation, said it “would be very interesting to see the reception to Xi’s words today in Washington” as whether the speech start a conversation between the two sides.\nQian Keming, a Chinese vice commerce minister, said Beijing was trying to “set an example for the world in terms of market opening”.\n“We see the trade disputes with the US as a fight between free trade and protectionism,” he said.\nAdditional reporting by Wendy Wu in Beijing and Sarah Zheng in Hong Kong\nYou are signed up.

The dollar was down about 1 per cent against the yen.\nThe dollar has been pressured for months by the view that the Federal Reserve is no longer the only game in town when it comes to tighter monetary policy as growth in other regions, Europe in particular, picks up speed.\nEuro zone businesses kicked off 2018 in much better shape than anyone polled by Reuters expected, ramping up activity at the fastest rate since mid-2006, a survey showed.\nInvestors were keenly awaiting the European Central Bank’s meeting on Thursday for clues on the outlook for euro zone monetary policy.\nThe euro may have more room to rise given the negative sentiment around the US dollar, Trang said.\nSterling jumped above US$1.42 after strong British employment data helped extend a recent rally driven by optimism Britain will have a relatively smooth exit from the European Union.\nYou are signed up.

The ship can run 80 kilometers after being fully charged. XIA SHIYAN/CHINA DAILY\nThe ship, manufactured by the Guangzhou Shipyard International Company Ltd, represents a technological breakthrough as it is the first in the world to use lithium battery in a fully powered cargo vessel running in the inland section of the Pearl River.\nAfter being charged for two hours, the ship can run 80 kilometers, according to Guangzhou Shipyard International. The company is the mainland's first shipbuilding company listed in Shanghai and Hong Kong, and is wholly owned by CSSC Offshore & Marine Engineering (Group) Company Ltd under the China State Shipbuilding Corporation Group.\nThe ship, 70.5 meters in length, has battery energy of about 2,400 kilowatt hours, or about the same energy of 40 new energy cars. Its highest speed tops out at 12.8 kilometers per hour, and there is zero emission of waste gas pollutants.\n\"As the ship is fully electric powered, it poses no threats to the environment. The technology will soon be likely ... used in passenger or engineering ships,\" said Huang Jialin, chairman and general manager of Hangzhou Modern Ship Design & Research Co, which designed the electric cargo vessel.\nAccording to Chen Ji, general manger of Guangzhou Shipyard International, the ship will be mainly used to run in the inland section of the Pearl River, carrying coal for the generation of electric power.\nAccording to Chen, use of the new-energy cargo vessel would help greatly reduce shipping costs for electric power operators.\n\"The cost of electric power is less than that (of) traditional fuel. The main cost of the new energy cargo ship depends on how much lithium battery it is equipped with,\" Chen said.\nAccording to Chen, the ship was built on a base of a series of new technologies and solutions.\n\"Theoretically, the fully electric-powered ship could have more capacity in cargo loading.

They start to close off. They start to get fearful,” he added. “If that continues to happen, make no mistake about it, we will all lose.”\n\n\nTrudeau didn’t mention the Donald Trump administration in Washington, but he’s already spoken out in China on the need to save the North American Free Trade Agreement from demise. He was delivering the message to a gathering of business leaders meeting under the banner of “Openness and Innovation: Shaping the Global Economy,” that brought together the chief executives from the world’s biggest companies.\nIn his speech, he singled out China as kindred economic spirit, saying it is “well aligned” with Canada to fight for liberalized trade.\nWe are at a pivot point in the world right now, where we decide whether we work together in an open and confident way and succeed or whether we all falter separately and isolated\n“In this new era, we refuse to get left behind; instead we have chosen to lead. We know there are significant disruptions around the world, in our workplaces, within our borders in our countries.”\nCanada and China are still working towards starting formal free talks, a task that has been given to International Trade Minister Francois-Philippe Champagne, who stayed behind in Beijing where Trudeau held meetings earlier in the week.\nTrudeau’s meetings in Beijing with China’s top leadership failed to move Canada-China free talks forward from a long round of exploratory talks to the start of formal negotiations. But both countries say economic bonds are stronger than ever as Trudeau was warmly welcomed by President Xi Jinping and Premier Li Keqiang in Beijing.\nTrudeau had separate meetings and dinners with Xi and Li before jetting south, where he spent the first of two days glad-handing with business leaders from Fortune 500 companies.\nTrudeau renewed his friendship with billionaire Jack Ma, the founder of the Asian e-commerce powerhouse Alibaba, who praised the prime minister for a new policy that will speed the Canadian visa process for skilled workers.\n“It’s going to be huge news among the Chinese young people,” Ma told him.\nThey have gathered at a 36-story luxury hotel that shoots through a dense haze overlooking the Pearl River, the grand waterway that winds through the busiest industrial concentration of companies on the planet — 70 million people in nine southern Chinese cities.\nCanada is no slouch either, the prime minister said.\n“We’re becoming the go-to economy for ambitious companies looking to take their business to the next level,” Trudeau said in his keynote address.\nHe said Canada is becoming a world leader in artificial intelligence, robotics, and quantum computing. He said Canada is a stable and predictable destination for investment with a good banking system.\nThe prime minister made it clear he wants Canada to move forward with the trade talks with China but said there needs to be an agreed framework that includes progressive elements such as gender, labour rights and the environment.\n“China and Canada share the belief that more openness and more collaboration is the right way forward. Closing our doors will only hurt our businesses, and our citizens,” Trudeau said.\n“The old model won’t cut it anymore.”\nTrudeau began Wednesday with a meeting of Chinese Vice Premier Wang Yang, who decried the forces of protectionism as like living in a “dark room.”\nTrudeau displayed a fond nostalgia for this city, which he visited 22 years ago he was a student backpacker. He told Wang the connections between this city and Canada run deep because many of the earliest Chinese immigrants came from this region.\nHe returned to Shamian Island, a beautiful tree-lined garden oasis in the city, where families with young children, millennials, and many others strolled on the square cobblestone boulevard lined with green and pink foliage under a canopy of Banyan trees.\nTrudeau said he vividly remembered walking the streets of the picturesque neighbourhood, in what was once the city’s embassy district, during a visit with the Li Xi, the secretary of the Communist Party of Guangdong province, at an ornate yellow Spanish Colonial guesthouse with stained glass windows.\nTrudeau capped a whirlwind day by marking a much darker memory in the history of another city much closer to him: he took part in a candle lighting ceremony at the Canadian consulate to mark the 28th anniversary of the 1989 massacre at Montreal’s Ecole Polytechnique, where a gunman killed 14 women.\nWe want to improve your reading experience\nCalculate your monthly mortgage payments\nCompare payments and other costs associated with getting a new mortgage\nBegin the process of finding out how much you can borrow\nSee how much you have left to save and where your money is being spent\nSee how much your investment savings could be worth\nWhat will it take to help reach your savings goals\nCompare currencies from across the globe\nCalculate what it will take you to save one million dollars\n"}

Their wish is not only to save themselves from globalisation, but to change the natural flow of globalisation,” Modi said at the opening of the forum, which has attracted 70 heads of state and government, chief executives and top bankers.\n“The result of this is that we are seeing new types of tariff and non-tariff-based barriers being imposed. Bilateral and multilateral trade negotiations appear to have come to a halt.\n“There is a slowdown in cross-border financial investments and the expansion of [the] global supply chain appears to have slowed down.”\nTrump has been pushing an “America First” policy of getting businesses to invest in the United States instead of overseas, potentially affecting the growth prospects of emerging economies such as India dependent on foreign investment.\nDuring his 2016 election campaign, he blamed globalisation for ravaging US manufacturing jobs as companies sought to reduce labour costs by relocating to Mexico and elsewhere. Trump is due to address the forum on Friday.\nExperts argue Trump doesn’t understand trade deficits ahead of visit to World Economic Forum in Switzerland\nBlackRock vice-chairman Philipp Hildebrand said Trump’s protectionist US trade policies were the biggest risk to a global economic recovery.\n“It all depends on what ‘America First’ means,” he said. “If it means to fundamentally unravel and destroy the global trading order in a highly complicated supply chain world that would be bad news for the global economy.”\nMeanwhile, the American leader’s recent US$1.5 trillion tax overhaul drew praise and warnings from finance chiefs at the annual meeting.\nA month since Trump slashed the corporate tax rate to 21 per cent from 35 per cent and cut individual levies across the board, Stephen Schwarzman, the chief executive officer of Blackstone Group LP, said such reductions would spark investment in the US.\n“There are going to be a lot of flows into the United States, and this is an underestimated to forgotten aspect of the US tax reform,” Schwarzman said. “There are companies all around the world now looking at US, saying this is the place to be in the developed world,”\nBut not everyone at the gathering – where billionaires, world leaders and investors hobnob and discuss topics ranging from the global economy and sexual harassment, to the risks and opportunities of artificial intelligence – were sold on Trump’s tax overhaul.\nBrian Moynihan, chief executive of Bank of America Corp., said a 4.1 per cent unemployment rate meant the “reality of bringing a lot of jobs back is difficult. Where are the people to do the work?”\nFrank Appel, the chief executive of Deutsche Post AG, predicted the tax cut would deliver a “limited short-term impact”, but would swell the budget deficit and wouldn’t do anything to boost productivity.\nThe debate came a day after the International Monetary Fund cited the tax revamp as a reason it now expected stronger expansion globally this year and next. But it added the effect would wear off by 2022 as some of the individual cuts expire and the US tries to curb its budget deficit.\nReporting by Reuters and Bloomberg\nYou are signed up.

The look on [Targaryen’s] face is going to be interesting” when she learns she is Snow’s aunt, says Cunningham.\nWhy Game of Thrones’ Liam Cunningham doesn’t want to be called a movie star\nBefore the Targaryen-Snow tryst in the Emmy-winning HBO drama, the biggest collection of characters in recent seasons came together to discuss a temporary truce in a dragon pit.\nThe actual setting, a Roman Empire-era coliseum in Spain, was “an extraordinary location,” says the Irish actor, 56, “about an hour-and-a-half drive from Westeros.”\n“When you’re aware of what we were standing on, which is an arena where a lot of people died a long time ago, there are a lot of ghosts in that place,” he says.\nThe scene, “where there was as much going on off the dialogue as there was in the dialogue,” featured “these wonderful actors standing on a stage. It was like an old-fashioned proscenium arch. This is proper acting, no film-star stuff,” he says. “I felt Lena Headey, [who plays Cersei Lannister], was absolutely amazing and Peter [Dinklage, who plays Tyrion Lannister], was glorious.”\nIn the Game of Thrones finale, a negotiation technique becomes a game-changer\nThe dragon pit scenes served as a wonderful reunion for the actors, too, Cunningham says.\n“It was extraordinary to be there with this gang of people who only normally meet on red carpets,” he says. “Our evenings were filled with beautiful Spanish food and very small amounts of beer. It was lovely.”\nBack in fictional Westeros, however, the characters are facing daunting odds, both from the White Walker threat to the north and Cersei’s secret plan not to join with the other armies against the northern invaders.\nThe White Walkers “are on their way. Just as [Seaworth and Snow] have convinced everybody this is going to happen, right at the end of the episode they’ve come through the Wall. They’re now in the Seven Kingdoms,” he says. “The Night King is on the back of a dragon. It’s not a White Walker, it’s a white flyer.”\nHere’s how much it costs HBO to produce one episode of Game of Thrones\nCunningham doesn’t expect to see any Season 8 scripts for a couple of weeks – filming may start in October, but that could change – but he knows the stakes will be higher in the final season.\n“This is for the survival of the Seven Kingdoms. It is not these little battles any more, Cersei [against] Targaryen. All bets are off,” he says.\nThe only thing more surprising than low-born Seaworth’s position as Snow’s esteemed adviser, which contrasts with his earlier career as a smuggler, may be that Seaworth is here at all.\n“Who would have put money on Seaworth making it this far? I should have put some money on it,” Cunningham says. “I did have an ambition a couple of seasons ago to go, ‘I’d love to make it to the last season.’ Of course, being a typical actor, now I say, ‘If I make it to the last season, I want to make it to the last episode.’ Whether I will or not is anybody’s guess.”\nYou are signed up.

The effort is designed to increase exchanges and cooperation with the European and American countries on technological achievements, innovative projects and talents. This April the city's Guangzhou Automobile Group, one of the Fortune Global 500, established a R&D center in the Silicon Valley. The center will focus on research and development involving new energy, new materials, advanced parts and electronic equipment in a way to keep pace with an ever-changing landscape of these globally-connected industries.\nIn the beginning of this year, it took only 50 days to negotiate a location for a USD 8.8 billion Foxconn factory in Guangzhou, showcasing the \"Chinese Efficiency\" that is present due to a more market-oriented and law-based international modern business environment.\nIn June, the 800-million-USD-worth biotech park, jointly invested by General Electric Company and Guangzhou Development District was launched in Sino-Singapore Guangzhou Knowledge City.

At least one expert said Chinese companies were increasingly innovating in more hardcore technological areas.\nWhen asked if China was becoming stricter toward foreign companies operating within the mainland, Oschmann said he was seeing \"a lot more assertiveness and that is only natural given the size of the market and the importance of China in the world economy.\"\nHe added that the Chinese government, and business partners, understand Merck's value as a partner in helping to upgrade their industries in areas such as biotechnology and electronics.\nOne common gripe many foreign companies have when it comes to doing business in China is around intellectual property theft. But recently, Beijing has cracked down on intellectual property rights violations including corporate espionage and counterfeiting of well-known brands.\n\"We see that China is becoming much more positive toward intellectual property protection,\" Oschmann said, adding that particularly was the case in the pharmaceutical sector. He added that, while China's IP legislation was \"very, very good\" in theory, the problem lies with enforcing it against those violating the laws.\n\"That's where the Chinese government needs to evolve the system. It must be more predictable. Companies must have a more predictable environment when it comes to enforcing IP,\" he said, adding that he thinks the state of affairs is moving in the right direction.\nOn another note, Oschmann addressed the potential sale of Merck's consumer health unit. Reuters reported late last week, citing sources, that Swiss food giant Nestle and private equity owners of German drug firm Stada were both preparing tentative bids for that business.\nOschmann said Merck's consumer health business is performing very well: \"Last quarter, we had 11 percent topline growth,\" he said, adding that the dynamics of the market were changing rapidly.\n\"Size has become so important in consumer health and we believe we're not the best owner of that business going forward,\" he added. Oschmann said he expects that a deal could potentially be signed by the second quarter of next year, although closing an agreement would take a longer time due to regulatory approval process.\n\nPlaying\nShare this video...\nWatch Next...\n"}

At Davos, he said, it was clear that: “Macron has shifted perceptions.”\n\n\nFrance’s reputation for smothering bureaucracy in addition to high taxes, and a labour code that's not business friendly, has made it hard for the country to attract foreign investment and talent.\n“For the first time in a long time I sense optimism both in France and from investors looking at France,” Paul Rawlinson, global president of law firm Baker McKenzie, told French daily Le Monde in Davos.\nAnd the “Macron effect”, as the French press has taken to calling it, has something to do with it. “He’s competent, well-versed in the details. He’s very impressive,” observed JP Morgan chairman Jamie Dimon, also speaking to Le Monde.\nIn his speech, Macron said he wanted to make it easier to fail and take risks in France. He alternated between French and English as he spoke, sprinkling English words like “business friendly”, “free-riding”, “hub”, “gap”, “device”, “shadow banking”, and “race to the bottom” into the French part of his speech.\nBut Macron is using more than words to woo the business community. In addition to recent tax breaks and labour reforms, Macron held a sumptuous dinner at Versailles on Monday where the French president asked 140 multinational business leaders to #ChooseFrance. Many of them used the dinner, billed as a “warm-up” to the Davos summit, to announce major French investments.\n\nFrench President at #ChooseFrance talking about reforms and modernization of France.Useful talk in front of such audience.CEOs of Samsung, Fujitsu, SAP, JP Morgan, Reliance ... at the same table !Impressive efficiency. pic.twitter.com/P1ldB6FXDg\n\nFacebook announced that it would expand its Paris Artificial Intelligence team and spend $12.2 million on new equipment. Germany's software giant SAP pledged to spend €2.5 billion in France over the next five years. Toyota will invest €300 million to increase capacity at a plant in northern France, creating up to 700 new jobs. Google will open four Google hubs and add 1,000 jobs.\n“France has all the assets to succeed. It has top engineers, great entrepreneurs, one of the best education systems in the world, great infrastructure, and successful global companies,” wrote Google CEO Sundar Pichai in a blog post detailing the plan.\nThirty-eight thousand engineers graduate in France every year. The country is also home to more than 9,400 startups and the world’s largest startup incubator, Station F, which opened in Paris in June.\nNew confidence\nMacron has \"completely changed\" France's image, telecoms billionaire and Station F-backer Xavier Niel said Wednesday, crediting the youthful, pro-business politician with attracting an influx of tech talent.\nSince his election in May 2017, the former investment banker has already pushed through labour law reforms that make it easier for businesses to fire workers. He has also sharply cut wealth and capital gains taxes. He is capitalising on high confidence in Europe and uncertainty over Brexit to lure companies to France.\nA survey by the US Chamber of Commerce and consultancy Bain & Company in November found a record 72 percent of US investors were optimistic about the French economy, up from just 30 percent in 2016.\nMacron is “perceived as a pro-business president”, said the Bain report. American investors see this political change as a sign of a major transformation in France, the start of \"a French New Deal\".\nHowever, the report warned that while France had made great progress in revamping its image, the UK and Germany remain better positioned to attract investment. The durability of the “Macron Effect” will depend on the success of Macron’s reforms and his ability to explain them to foreign investors, the report concluded.\nNot just the 'Macron Effect'\nWhile Macron has won most of the credit for boosting France’s image, some of the country's business-friendly moves predate his election. Macron’s predecessor, François Hollande, set up new visas for digital entrepreneurs while in 2015 a dozen French startups launched the WonderLeon campaign to lure overseas French talent back home.\n\"What I'm seeing right now is that France is starting to look like what I saw in London 10 or 12 years ago. There's a lot of evolution. We're on a good path,\" said Jean-Michel Petit, CEO of food startup VizEat, speaking at a WonderLeon event in 2017.\nVenture capital investment increased to more than €2.2 billion in 2016, putting France second only to the UK on the European startup scene. France took the lead in the first eight months of 2017, raising €2.7 billion--nine times more than for the full year of 2014.\nDate created : 2018-01-27\n\nDavos 2018 Wrap - The takeaway from this year's World Economic Forum\nRead more\n\nDavos 2018: Macron calls for cooperation and reform\nRead more\n\n'France is back': Macron touts France, in English, before Davos elite\nRead more\nCOMMENT(S)\n\nRead more\n\nRead more\n\nRead more\n\nRead more\n\nRead more\n\nRead more\n\nRead more\n\nRead more\n\nRead more\n\nRead more\n\nRead more\n\nRead more\nLive news\nAll the news\nUSA\nUS judge bars Trump from blocking critics on Twitter\nRead more\nAfter two decades, Roland Garros conquers greenhouse effect\nRead more\nWest Hollywood grants Stormy Daniels keys to the city\nRead more\nTrump administration weighs slapping tariffs on auto imports\nRead more\nAll the news\n\nRead more\nFeatured\n\nRead more\n\nRead more\n\nRead more\n\nRead more\n\nRead more\n\nRead more\n\nRead more\n\nRead more\nNews\nOn TV\nBeyond the news\nOnline services\n© 2018 Copyright France 24 – All rights reserved\nFrance 24 is not responsible for the content of external websites\nsearch\ne-mail\nFrance Médias Monde\nWatch us on TV\nTravel\nFrançais English Español عربي\nAccessibility\n"}

And some of these reforms will go beyond “the expectations of the international community”, he said.\nLiu’s speech in Davos could be seen as an effort to reassure the international community.\nIn an article published before the 19th party congress last year, I outlined the three trends we could expect of China’s development in the next five years. One was that Beijing’s grip on the economy would start to ease and the pace of economic reform would pick up. Liu’s speech has proven this prediction right.\nWhat Liu said was nothing new; he merely elaborated on the Chinese economic blueprint that was unveiled at the 19th party congress. But given Liu’s position, global investors and analysts were right to pay attention.\nLiu said China’s economic policy in the next few years would be centred around “one key necessity, a main task and three critical battles”. The key necessity involves shifting the economy from a phase of rapid growth to one of high-quality development, and all of Beijing’s macroeconomic, structural and social policies would be designed to support this transition. The three critical battles are: preventing and resolving major financial risks; making targeted efforts to reduce poverty; and controlling pollution.\nOn economic reform, Liu said it would be deepened to allow the market to play a decisive role in allocating resources, protect private property, especially intellectual property, and give full play to the role of entrepreneurs. This would encourage competition, curb monopolies and improve the macroeconomic regulatory regime.\nChina would also continue to open up, align itself with the global rules of trade, increase market access, expand the services sector, especially the financial sector, and create a welcoming environment for investors.\nWhy is China stepping up its reform and opening up on the 40th anniversary of this policy’s introduction? One reason is China must do so to meet the first of Xi’s two “centenary goals” – to build a moderately prosperous society by 2021 to mark the 100th anniversary of the founding of the Communist Party. The goal cannot be reached without reducing poverty. This is why poverty reduction is one of the three major tasks for the coming years.\nFurthermore, with China today facing an L-shaped growth trajectory, reforms are vital to keep the economy going forward.\nIt’s likely that the external environment has also played a part in China’s pledge to introduce reform measures that exceed expectations. In recent years, the United States and Europe have been highly critical of what they say are China’s protectionist policies. US President Donald Trump has threatened to launch a trade war with China over America’s trade deficit.\nMeanwhile, the White House is reportedly considering a “reciprocal investment regime” that would restrict Chinese investment in the US to the extent that China is restricting American investments in its market. If such a regime does materialise, the EU and Japan might follow suit, which would make it difficult for Chinese companies to enter European and US markets.\nChina became a capital-exporting country a few years ago, and mainland companies expanding overseas benefit from the mature markets and well-established legal systems in the US and Europe. That is why a move to enforce reciprocity would be a barrier for Chinese firms seeking access to foreign markets.\nIn addition, Trump’s tax overhaul, which could set off a round of tax cuts in other major economies, also poses a challenge for China.\nUnder these circumstances, China has no choice but to deepen its reform and opening up. Unless it is prepared to fight a trade war or see Chinese businesses barred from other markets, China has to open up its less competitive sectors that it has been protecting under the pretext of “national security” and other concerns.\nWe can assume Liu’s speech reflects Xi’s thinking. In his New Year address, Xi said reform and opening up should be advanced at a faster pace this year.\nThere are other reasons why Xi wants to speed up reform and opening up in the next few years. Five years of a vigorous anti-corruption drive and a campaign to clean up the Communist Party have nevertheless created new hurdles for China’s reform agenda. Objectively, the crackdown has succeeded in building a cleaner government, but it has also encouraged a “wait and see” attitude among government officials. Many have little incentive to push forward bold reforms for fear of inadvertently violating a rule. This is why the push to reform and open up has reached a stalemate.\nThe intensity and approach of the anti-corruption drive must be adjusted; the fight against graft must be normalised, so that it does not undermine officials’ initiatives to introduce change.\nBesides, after such an extensive anti-graft campaign, Xi has basically eliminated his opposition in the party. So he should have more time and space now to contemplate how to tackle the deep-rooted problems in the reform drive.\nThere are signs that the reform drive has already been rebooted.\nFor example, late last year, Chinese courts announced the retrials of three criminal cases relating to property rights, putting in action the government’s intention to better protect private property and restore business confidence.\nAlso late last year, the authorities rolled out a new measure that gives foreign firms a tax exemption if they reinvest their profits.\n\nRecently, the State Council’s State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission confirmed that its power to appoint and dismiss the heads of state-owned companies would be delegated to the companies’ boards.\nBeijing is also likely to unveil more reform measures after the “two sessions” legislative meetings in March.\nThe international community should cheer the market-opening measures that may come. However, they should know that such measures would be restricted to the economic sphere, touching on the social sphere at most.\nExpect little easing to happen in politics. Perhaps there may be some small improvements in certain areas, but on matters concerning major principles and sensitive issues, the government’s grip may even tighten.\nA more optimistic forecast is that China’s reform drive would return to what it was during the Jiang Zemin and Hu Jintao eras. Instead of tacking left in both politics and economics, as things stand currently, Xi would turn right on economics while remaining left on politics. If that is true, however, serious imbalances may once again emerge.\nDeng Yuwen is a researcher at the Charhar Institute think tank. This is translated from Chinese\nYou are signed up.

To hear more feature stories, download the Audm app for your iPhone.\nWhen the Chinese action movie “Wolf Warrior II” arrived in theatres, in July, it looked like a standard shoot-’em-up, with a lonesome hero and frequent explosions. Within two weeks, however, “Wolf Warrior II” had become the highest-grossing Chinese movie of all time. Some crowds gave it standing ovations; others sang the national anthem. In October, China selected it as its official entry in the foreign-language category of the Academy Awards.\nThe hero, Leng Feng, played by the action star Wu Jing (who also directed the film), is a veteran of the “wolf warriors,” special forces of the People’s Liberation Army. In retirement, he works as a guard in a fictional African country, on the frontier of China’s ventures abroad. A rebel army, backed by Western mercenaries, attempts to seize power, and the country is engulfed in civil war. Leng shepherds civilians to the gates of the Chinese Embassy, where the Ambassador wades into the battle and declares, “Stand down! We are Chinese! China and Africa are friends.” The rebels hold their fire, and survivors are spirited to safety aboard a Chinese battleship.\nLeng rescues an American doctor, who tells him that the Marines will come to their aid. “But where are they now?” he asks her. She calls the American consulate and gets a recorded message: “Unfortunately, we are closed.” In the final battle, a villain, played by the American actor Frank Grillo, tells Leng, “People like you will always be inferior to people like me. Get used to it.” Leng beats the villain to death and replies, “That was fucking history.” The film closes with the image of a Chinese passport and the words “Don’t give up if you run into danger abroad. Please remember, a strong motherland will always have your back!”\nWhen I moved to Beijing, in 2005, little of that story would have made sense to a Chinese audience. With doses of invention and schmalz, the movie draws on recent events. In 2015, China’s Navy conducted its first international evacuation, rescuing civilians from fighting in Yemen; last year, China opened its first overseas military base, in Djibouti. There has been a deeper development as well. For decades, Chinese nationalism revolved around victimhood: the bitter legacy of invasion and imperialism, and the memory of a China so weak that, at the end of the nineteenth century, the philosopher Liang Qichao called his country “the sick man of Asia.” “Wolf Warrior II” captures a new, muscular iteration of China’s self-narrative, much as Rambo’s heroics expressed the swagger of the Reagan era.\nRecently, I met Wu Jing in Los Angeles, where he was promoting the movie in advance of the Academy Awards. Wu is forty-three, with short, spiky hair, a strong jaw, and an air of prickly bravado. He was on crutches, the result of “jumping off too many buildings,” he told me, in Chinese. (He speaks little English.) “In the past, all of our movies were about, say, the Opium Wars—how other countries waged war against China,” he said. “But Chinese people have always wanted to see that our country could, one day, have the power to protect its own people and contribute to peace in the world.”\nAs a favored son of China, celebrated by the state, Wu doesn’t complain about censorship and propaganda. He went on, “Although we’re not living in a peaceful time, we live in a peaceful country. I don’t think we should be spending much energy thinking about negative aspects that would make us unhappy. Cherish this moment!”\n“Wolf Warrior II” Captures China’s Newfound Identity An interview with Wu Jing, the star and director of the film.\nChina has never seen such a moment, when its pursuit of a larger role in the world coincides with America’s pursuit of a smaller one. Ever since the Second World War, the United States has advocated an international order based on a free press and judiciary, human rights, free trade, and protection of the environment. It planted those ideas in the rebuilding of Germany and Japan, and spread them with alliances around the world. In March, 1959, President Eisenhower argued that America’s authority could not rest on military power alone. “We could be the wealthiest and the most mighty nation and still lose the battle of the world if we do not help our world neighbors protect their freedom and advance their social and economic progress,” he said. “It is not the goal of the American people that the United States should be the richest nation in the graveyard of history.”\nUnder the banner of “America First,” President Trump is reducing U.S. commitments abroad. On his third day in office, he withdrew from the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a twelve-nation trade deal designed by the United States as a counterweight to a rising China. To allies in Asia, the withdrawal damaged America’s credibility. “You won’t be able to see that overnight,” Lee Hsien Loong, the Prime Minister of Singapore, told me, at an event in Washington. “It’s like when you draw a red line and then you don’t take it seriously. Was there pain? You didn’t see it, but I’m quite sure there’s an impact.”\nIn a speech to Communist Party officials last January 20th, Major General Jin Yinan, a strategist at China’s National Defense University, celebrated America’s pullout from the trade deal. “We are quiet about it,” he said. “We repeatedly state that Trump ‘harms China.’ We want to keep it that way. In fact, he has given China a huge gift. That is the American withdrawal from T.P.P.” Jin, whose remarks later circulated, told his audience, “As the U.S. retreats globally, China shows up.”\nFor years, China’s leaders predicted that a time would come—perhaps midway through this century—when it could project its own values abroad. In the age of “America First,” that time has come far sooner than expected.\nBarack Obama’s foreign policy was characterized as leading from behind. Trump’s doctrine may come to be understood as retreating from the front. Trump has severed American commitments that he considers risky, costly, or politically unappealing. In his first week in office, he tried to ban travellers from seven Muslim-majority countries, arguing that they pose a terrorist threat. (After court battles, a version of the ban took effect in December.) He announced his intention to withdraw the U.S. from the Paris Agreement on climate change and from UNESCO, and he abandoned United Nations talks on migration. He has said that he might renege on the Iran nuclear deal, a free-trade agreement with South Korea, and NAFTA. His proposal for the 2018 budget would cut foreign assistance by forty-two per cent, or $11.5 billion, and it reduces American funding for development projects, such as those financed by the World Bank. In December, Trump threatened to cut off aid to any country that supports a resolution condemning his decision to recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. (The next day, in defiance of Trump’s threat, the resolution passed overwhelmingly.)\nTo frame his vision of a smaller presence abroad, Trump often portrays America’s urgent task as one of survival. As he put it during the campaign, “At what point do you say, ‘Hey, we have to take care of ourselves’? So, you know, I know the outer world exists and I’ll be very cognizant of that, but, at the same time, our country is disintegrating.”\nSo far, Trump has proposed reducing U.S. contributions to the U.N. by forty per cent, and pressured the General Assembly to cut six hundred million dollars from its peacekeeping budget. In his first speech to the U.N., in September, Trump ignored its collective spirit and celebrated sovereignty above all, saying, “As President of the United States, I will always put America first, just like you, as the leaders of your countries, will always and should always put your countries first.”\nChina’s approach is more ambitious. In recent years, it has taken steps to accrue national power on a scale that no country has attempted since the Cold War, by increasing its investments in the types of assets that established American authority in the previous century: foreign aid, overseas security, foreign influence, and the most advanced new technologies, such as artificial intelligence. It has become one of the leading contributors to the U.N.’s budget and to its peacekeeping force, and it has joined talks to address global problems such as terrorism, piracy, and nuclear proliferation.\nAnd China has embarked on history’s most expensive foreign infrastructure plan. Under the Belt and Road Initiative, it is building bridges, railways, and ports in Asia, Africa, and beyond. If the initiative’s cost reaches a trillion dollars, as predicted, it will be more than seven times that of the Marshall Plan, which the U.S. launched in 1947, spending a hundred and thirty billion, in today’s dollars, on rebuilding postwar Europe.\nChina is also seizing immediate opportunities presented by Trump. Days before the T.P.P. withdrawal, President Xi Jinping spoke at the World Economic Forum, in Davos, Switzerland, a first for a paramount Chinese leader. Xi reiterated his support for the Paris climate deal and compared protectionism to “locking oneself in a dark room.” He said, “No one will emerge as a winner in a trade war.” This was an ironic performance—for decades, China has relied on protectionism—but Trump provided an irresistible opening. China is negotiating with at least sixteen countries to form the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership, a free-trade zone that excludes the United States, which it proposed in 2012 as a response to the T.P.P. If the deal is signed next year, as projected, it will create the world’s largest trade bloc, by population.\nSome of China’s growing sway is unseen by the public. In October, the World Trade Organization convened ministers from nearly forty countries in Marrakech, Morocco, for the kind of routine diplomatic session that updates rules on trade in agriculture and seafood. The Trump Administration, which has been critical of the W.T.O., sent an official who delivered a speech and departed early. “For two days of meetings, there were no Americans,” a former U.S. official told me. “And the Chinese were going into every session and chortling about how they were now guarantors of the trading system.”\nBy setting more of the world’s rules, China hopes to “break the Western moral advantage,” which identifies “good and bad” political systems, as Li Ziguo, at the China Institute of International Studies, has said. In November, 2016, Meng Hongwei, a Chinese vice-minister of public security, became the first Chinese president of Interpol, the international police organization; the move alarmed human-rights groups, because Interpol has been criticized for helping authoritarian governments target and harass dissidents and pro-democracy activists abroad.\nBy some measures, the U.S. will remain dominant for years to come. It has at least twelve aircraft carriers. China has two. The U.S. has collective defense treaties with more than fifty countries. China has one, with North Korea. Moreover, China’s economic path is complicated by heavy debts, bloated state-owned enterprises, rising inequality, and slowing growth. The workers who once powered China’s boom are graying. China’s air, water, and soil are disastrously polluted.\nAnd yet the gap has narrowed. In 2000, the U.S. accounted for thirty-one per cent of the global economy, and China accounted for four per cent. Today, the U.S.’s share is twenty-four per cent and China’s fifteen per cent. If its economy surpasses America’s in size, as experts predict, it will be the first time in more than a century that the world’s largest economy belongs to a non-democratic country. At that point, China will play a larger role in shaping, or thwarting, values such as competitive elections, freedom of expression, and an open Internet. Already, the world has less confidence in America than we might guess. Last year, the Pew Research Center asked people in thirty-seven countries which leader would do the right thing when it came to world affairs. They chose Xi Jinping over Donald Trump, twenty-eight per cent to twenty-two per cent.\nFacing criticism for his lack of interest in global leadership, Trump, in December, issued a national-security strategy that singled out China and Russia and declared, “We will raise our competitive game to meet that challenge, to protect American interests, and to advance our values.” But, in his speech unveiling the strategy, he hailed his pullout from “job-killing deals such as the Trans-Pacific Partnership and the very expensive and unfair Paris climate accord.” The next day, Roger Cohen, of the Times, described the contradictions of Trump’s foreign policy as a “farce.” Some allies have taken to avoiding the Administration. “I’ll tell you, honestly, for a foreigner, in the past we were used to going to the White House to get our work done,” Shivshankar Menon, India’s former foreign secretary and national-security adviser to the Prime Minister, told me. “Now we go to the corporations, to Congress, to the Pentagon, wherever.”\nOn his recent visit to Washington, Prime Minister Lee, of Singapore, said that the rest of the world can no longer pretend to ignore the contrasts between American and Chinese leadership. “Since the war, you’ve held the peace. You’ve provided security. You’ve opened your markets. You’ve developed links across the Pacific,” he said. “And now, with a rising set of players on the west coast of the Pacific, where does America want to go? Do you want to be engaged?” He went on, “If you are not there, then everybody else in the world will look around and say, I want to be friends with both the U.S. and the Chinese—and the Chinese are ready, and I’ll start with them.”\nXi Jinping has the kind of Presidency that Donald Trump might prefer. Last fall, he started his second term with more unobstructed power than any Chinese leader since Deng Xiaoping, who died in 1997. The Nineteenth Party Congress, held in October, had the spirit of a coronation, in which the Party declared Xi the “core leader,” an honor conferred only three other times since the founding of the nation (on Mao Zedong, Deng, and Jiang Zemin), and added “Xi Jinping Thought” to its constitution—effectively allowing him to hold power for life, if he chooses. He enjoys total dominion over the media: at the formal unveiling of his new Politburo, the Party barred Western news organizations that it finds troublesome; when Xi appeared on front pages across the country, his visage was a thing of perfection, airbrushed by Party “news workers” to the sheen of a summer peach.\nFor decades, China avoided directly challenging America’s primacy in the global order, instead pursuing a strategy that Deng, in 1990, called “hide your strength and bide your time.” But Xi, in his speech to the Party Congress, declared the dawn of “a new era,” one in which China moves “closer to center stage.” He presented China as “a new option for other countries,” calling this alternative to Western democracy the zhongguo fang’an, the “Chinese solution.”\nWhen I arrived in Beijing a few weeks later, the pipe organ of Chinese propaganda was at full force. The state press ran a profile of Xi that was effusive even by the standards of the form, depicting him as an “unrivalled helmsman,” whose “extensive knowledge of literature and the arts makes him a consummate communicator in the international arena.” The article observed, “Xi treats everyone with sincerity, warmth, attentiveness, and forthrightness.” It quoted a Russian linguist who had translated his Party Congress speech: “I read from morning till midnight, even forgetting to have meals.”\nXi has inscribed on his country a rigid vision of modernity. A campaign to clean up “low-end population” has evicted migrant workers from Beijing, and a campaign against dissent has evicted the most outspoken intellectuals from online debate. The Party is reaching deeper into private institutions. Foreign universities with programs in China, such as Duke, have been advised that they must elevate a Communist Party secretary to a decision-making role on their local boards of trustees. The Party is encouraging dark imaginings about the outside world: posters warn the public to “protect national secrets” and to watch out for “spies.” Beijing is more convenient than it was not long ago, but also less thrilling; it has gained wealth but lost some of its improvisational energy.\nUntil recently, Chinese nationalists were crowded out by a widespread desire to be embraced by the outside world. They see the parallel ascents of Xi and Trump as cause for celebration, and accuse “white lotuses,” their term for Chinese liberals, of sanctimony and intolerance. They reject political correctness in issues of race and worry about Islamic extremism. (Muslims, though they make up less than two per cent of China’s population, are the objects of fevered animosity on its Internet.) Last June, Yao Chen, one of China’s most popular actresses, received a barrage of criticism online after she tried to raise awareness of the global refugee crisis. (She was forced to clarify that she was not calling for China to accept refugees.)\nBack in 2008, I met a jittery young conservative named Rao Jin, a contrarian on the fringes of Chinese politics. Long before Trump launched his campaign or railed against the media, Rao created a Web site called Anti-CNN.com, which was dedicated to criticizing Western news coverage. Over lunch in Beijing recently, he exuded calm vindication. “Things that we used to push are now mainstream,” not only in China but globally, he said. In Rao’s view, Trump’s “America First” slogan is an honest declaration, a realist vision stripped of false altruism and piety. “From his perspective, America’s interests come first,” Rao said. “To Chinese people, this is a big truth, and you can’t deny it.” Rao has watched versions of his ideas gain strength in Russia, France, Great Britain, and the United States. “In this world, power speaks,” he said, making a fist, a gesture that Trump adopted in his Inauguration speech and Xi displayed in a photo taken at the start of his new term.\nChina’s leaders rarely air their views about an American President, but well-connected scholars—the ranking instituteniks of Beijing and Shanghai and Guangzhou—can map the contours of their assessments. Yan Xuetong is the dean of Tsinghua University’s Institute of Modern International Relations. At sixty-five, Yan is bouncy and trim, with short silver hair and a roaring laugh. When I arrived at his office one evening, he donned a black wool cap and coat, and we set off into the cold. Before I could ask a question, he said, “I think Trump is America’s Gorbachev.” In China, Mikhail Gorbachev is known as the leader who led an empire to collapse. “The United States will suffer,” he warned.\nOver a dinner of dumplings, tofu, and stir-fried pork, Yan said that America’s strength must be measured partly by its ability to persuade: “American leadership has already dramatically declined in the past ten months. In 1991, when Bush, Sr., launched the war against Iraq, it got thirty-four countries to join the war effort. This time, if Trump launched a war against anyone, I doubt he would get support from even five countries. Even the U.S. Congress is trying to block his ability to start a nuclear war against North Korea.” For Chinese leaders, Yan said, “Trump is the biggest strategic opportunity.” I asked Yan how long he thought the opportunity would last. “As long as Trump stays in power,” he replied.\nThe leadership in Beijing did not always have this view of Trump. In the years leading up to the 2016 election, it had adopted a confrontational posture toward the United States. Beijing worked with Washington on climate change and on the Iran nuclear deal, but tensions were building: China was hacking U.S. industrial secrets, building airports on top of reefs and rocks in the South China Sea, creating obstacles for American firms investing in China, blocking American Internet businesses, and denying visas to American scholars and journalists. During the campaign, China specialists in both parties called on the next President to strengthen alliances across Asia and to step up pressure on Beijing.\nWhen Trump won, the Party “was in a kind of shock,” Michael Pillsbury, a former Pentagon aide and the author of “The Hundred-Year Marathon,” a 2015 account of China’s global ambitions, told me. “They feared that he was their mortal enemy.” The leadership drafted potential strategies for retaliation, including threatening American companies in China and withholding investment from the districts of influential members of Congress.\nMost of all, they studied Trump. Kevin Rudd, the former Prime Minister of Australia, who is in contact with leaders in Beijing, told me, “Since the Chinese were stunned that Trump was elected, they were intrinsically respectful of how he could’ve achieved it. An entire battery of think tanks was set to work, to analyze how this had occurred and how Trump had negotiated his way through to prevail.”\nBefore he entered the White House, China started assembling a playbook for dealing with him. Shen Dingli, a foreign-affairs specialist at Fudan University, in Shanghai, explained that Trump is “very similar to Deng Xiaoping,” the pragmatic Party boss who opened China to economic reform. “Deng Xiaoping said, ‘Whatever can make China good is a good “ism.” ’ He doesn’t care if it’s capitalism. For Trump, it’s all about jobs,” Shen said.\nThe first test came less than a month after the election, when Trump took a call from Taiwan’s President, Tsai Ing-wen. “Xi Jinping was angry,” Shen said. “But Xi Jinping made a great effort not to create a war of words.” Instead, a few weeks later, Xi revealed a powerful new intercontinental ballistic missile. “It sends a message: I have this—what do you want to do?” Shen said. “Meantime, he sends Jack Ma”—the founder of the e-commerce giant Alibaba—“to meet with Trump in New York, offering one million jobs through Alibaba.” Shen went on, “China knows Trump can be unpredictable, so we have weapons to make him predictable, to contain him. He would trade Taiwan for jobs.”\nInside the new White House, there were two competing strategies on China. One, promoted by Stephen Bannon, then the chief strategist, wanted the President to take a hard line, even at the risk of a trade war. Bannon often described China as a “civilizational challenge.” The other view was associated with Jared Kushner, Trump’s son-in-law and adviser, who had received guidance from Henry Kissinger and met repeatedly with the Chinese Ambassador, Cui Tiankai. Kushner argued for a close, collegial bond between Xi and Trump, and he prevailed.\nHe and Rex Tillerson, the Secretary of State, arranged for Trump and Xi to meet at Mar-a-Lago on April 7th, for a cordial get-to-know-you summit. To set the tone, Trump presented two of Kushner and Ivanka Trump’s children, Arabella and Joseph, who sang “Jasmine Flower,” a classic Chinese ballad, and recited poetry. While Xi was at the resort, the Chinese government approved three trademark applications from Ivanka’s company, clearing the way for her to sell jewelry, handbags, and spa services in China.\nKushner has faced scrutiny for potential conflicts of interest arising from his China diplomacy and his family’s businesses. During the transition, Kushner dined with Chinese business executives while the Kushner Companies was seeking their investment in a Manhattan property. (After that was revealed in news reports, the firm ended the talks.) In May, Kushner’s sister, Nicole Kushner Meyer, was found to have mentioned his White House position while she courted investors during a trip to China. The Kushner Companies apologized.\nDuring the Mar-a-Lago meetings, Chinese officials noticed that, on some of China’s most sensitive issues, Trump did not know enough to push back. “Trump is taking what Xi Jinping says at face value—on Tibet, Taiwan, North Korea,” Daniel Russel, who was, until March, the Assistant Secretary of State for East Asian and Pacific Affairs, told me. “That was a big lesson for them.” Afterward, Trump conceded to the Wall Street Journal how little he understood about China’s relationship to North Korea: “After listening for ten minutes, I realized it’s not so easy.”\nRussel spoke to Chinese officials after the Mar-a-Lago visit. “The Chinese felt like they had Trump’s number,” he said. “Yes, there is this random, unpredictable Ouija-board quality to him that worries them, and they have to brace for some problems, but, fundamentally, what they said was ‘He’s a paper tiger.’ Because he hasn’t delivered on any of his threats. There’s no wall on Mexico. There’s no repeal of health care. He can’t get the Congress to back him up. He’s under investigation.”\nAfter the summit, the Pangoal Institution, a Beijing think tank, published an analysis of the Trump Administration, describing it as a den of warring “cliques,” the most influential of which was the “Trump family clan.” The Trump clan appears to “directly influence final decisions” on business and diplomacy in a way that “has rarely been seen in the political history of the United States,” the analyst wrote. He summed it up using an obscure phrase from feudal China: jiatianxia—“to treat the state as your possession.”\nAfter Mar-a-Lago, Trump heaped praise on Xi. “We had a great chemistry, I think. I mean, at least I had a great chemistry—maybe he didn’t like me, but I think he liked me,” he said on the Fox Business Network. Meanwhile, Chinese analysts were struggling to keep up with the news about the rise and fall of White House advisers. Following a report that Tillerson had disparaged the President’s intelligence, Shen, of Fudan University, asked me, “What is a moron?”\nBy early November, Trump was preparing for his first trip to Beijing. Some China specialists in the U.S. government saw it as a chance to press on substantive issues. “We have to start standing up for our interests, because they have come farther, and faster, than people thought, pretty much without anyone waking up to it,” a U.S. official involved in planning the visit told me. Among other things, the U.S. wanted China to open up areas of its economy, such as cloud computing, to foreign competitors; crack down on the theft of intellectual property; and stop forcing American firms to transfer technology as a condition for entry to the Chinese market. “It is time for a sense of urgency,” the official said.\nCui Tiankai, the Chinese Ambassador to Washington, billed Trump’s visit as a “state visit plus.” An American with high-level contacts in Beijing told me that they planned to “wow him with five thousand years of Chinese history. They believe he is uniquely susceptible to that.”\nThe strategy had worked before. In the mid-nineteen-eighties, the C.I.A. commissioned a China scholar named Richard Solomon to write a handbook for American leaders, “Chinese Political Negotiating Behavior.” Solomon, whose study was later declassified, noted that some of China’s most effective techniques were best described in the nineteenth century, when a Manchu prince named Qiying recorded his preferred approach. “Barbarians,” Qiying noted, respond well to “receptions and entertainment, after which they have had a feeling of appreciation.” Solomon warned that modern Chinese leaders “use the trappings of imperial China” to “impress foreign officials with their grandeur and seriousness of purpose.” Solomon advised, “Resist the flattery of being an ‘old friend’ or the sentimentality that Chinese hospitality readily evokes.” (Henry Kissinger, he wrote, once gushed to his hosts, “After a dinner of Peking duck I’ll agree to anything.”)\nFollowing the Nineteenth Party Congress, Trump marvelled at Xi’s new power. “Now some people might call him the king of China,” he told an interviewer, shortly before his trip. Trump arrived in more modest standing. A few hours before his plane touched down, on November 8th, Republicans were thumped in state elections, losing governors’ races in Virginia and New Jersey. His approval rating was thirty-seven per cent, the lowest of any President at that point in his tenure since Gallup started measuring it. Three former aides had been charged with felonies in the investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election. It was the first summit since 1972 in which the American President had less leverage and political security than his Chinese counterpart.\nXi deftly flattered his guest. Upon Trump’s arrival, they took a sunset tour of the Forbidden City. They drank tea, watched an opera performance at the Pavilion of Pleasant Sounds, and admired an antique gold urn. The next morning, at the Great Hall of the People, Trump was greeted by an even more lavish ceremony, with Chinese military bands, the firing of cannons, and throngs of schoolchildren, who waved colored pompoms and yelled, in Chinese, “Uncle Trump!” Government censors struck down critical comments about Trump on social media.\nTrump and Xi met for several hours and then appeared before the press. “The hosting of the military parade this morning was magnificent,” Trump said, and he praised Xi as a “highly respected and powerful representative of his people.” He mentioned the need to coöperate with regard to North Korea, and to fix an “unfair” trade relationship, but he said nothing about intellectual property or market access. “I don’t blame China,” Trump said. “Who can blame a country for being able to take advantage of another country for the benefit of its citizens?” There were gasps from business leaders and journalists. “I give China great credit.” Some Chinese members of the audience cheered. Xi and Trump took no questions from the press.\nIn preparations for Trump’s meeting with Xi, the State Department had urged the President to bring up a human-rights case: that of the poet Liu Xia, the widow of the late Nobel laureate Liu Xiaobo, who is under house arrest, without charges. According to two U.S. officials, Trump never mentioned it.\nTrump’s deference to Xi—the tributes and tender musings about chemistry—sent a message to other countries that are debating whether to tilt toward the U.S. or China. Daniel Russel said, “The American President is here. He’s looking in awe at the Forbidden City. He’s looking in awe at Xi Jinping, and he’s choosing China because of its market, because of its power. If you thought that America was going to choose you and these ‘old-fashioned’ treaties and twentieth-century values, instead of Xi Jinping and the Chinese market, well, think again.”\nIn concrete terms, why does it matter if America retreats and China advances? One realm in which the effects are visible is technology, where Chinese and American companies are competing not simply for profits but also to shape the rules concerning privacy, fairness, and censorship. China bars eleven of the world’s twenty-five most popular Web sites—including Google, YouTube, Facebook, and Wikipedia—because it fears they will dominate local competitors or amplify dissent. The Chinese government has promoted that approach under a doctrine that it calls “cyber-sovereignty.” In December, China hosted an Internet conference that attracted American C.E.O.s such as Tim Cook, of Apple, even though China has forced Apple to remove apps that allow users to circumvent the “Great Firewall.”\nIn Beijing, I hailed a cab and headed to the northwest corner of the city, where a Chinese company called SenseTime is working on facial recognition, a field at the intersection of science and individual rights. The company was founded in 2014 by Tang Xiao’ou, a computer scientist who trained at M.I.T. and returned to Hong Kong to teach. (For years, China’s startups lagged behind those in Silicon Valley. But there is more parity now. Of the forty-one private companies worldwide that reached “unicorn” status in 2017—meaning they had valuations of a billion dollars or more—fifteen are Chinese and seventeen are American.)\nSenseTime’s offices have a sleek, industrial look. Nobody wears an identification badge, because cameras recognize employees, causing doors to open. I was met there by June Jin, the chief marketing officer, who earned an M.B.A. at the University of Chicago and worked at Microsoft, Apple, and Tesla. Jin walked me over to a display of lighthearted commercial uses of facial-recognition technology. I stepped before a machine, which resembled a slender A.T.M., that assessed my “happiness” and other attributes, guessed that I am a thirty-three-year-old male, and, based on that information, played me an advertisement for skateboarding attire. When I stepped in front of it again, it revised its calculation to forty-one years old, and played me an ad for liquor. (I was, at the time, forty.) The machines are used in restaurants to entertain waiting guests. But they contain a hidden element of artificial intelligence as well: images are collected and compared with a facial database of V.I.P. customers. “A waiter or waitress comes up and maybe we get you a seat,” Jin said. “That’s the beauty of A.I.”\nNext, Jin showed me how the technology is used by police. She said, “We work very closely with the Public Security Bureau,” which applies SenseTime’s algorithms to millions of photo I.D.s. As a demonstration, using the company’s employee database, a video screen displayed a live feed of a busy intersection nearby. “In real time, it captures all the attributes of the cars and pedestrians,” she said. On an adjoining screen, a Pac-Man-like trail indicated a young man’s movements around the city, based only on his face. Jin said, “It can match a suspect with a criminal database. If the similarity level is over a certain threshold, then they can make an arrest on the spot.” She continued, “We work with more than forty police bureaus nationwide. Guangdong Province is always very open-minded and embracing technology, so, last year alone, we helped the Guangdong police bureau solve many crimes.”\nIn the U.S., where police departments and the F.B.I. are adopting comparable technology, facial recognition has prompted congressional debates about privacy and policing. The courts have yet to clarify when a city or a company can track a person’s face. Under what conditions can biometric data be used to find suspects of a crime, or be sold to advertisers? In Xi Jinping’s China, which values order over the rights of the individual, there are few such debates. In the city of Shenzhen, the local government uses facial recognition to deter jaywalkers. (At busy intersections, it posts their names and I.D. pictures on a screen at the roadside.) In Beijing, the government uses facial-recognition machines in public rest rooms to stop people from stealing toilet paper; it limits users to sixty centimetres within a nine-minute period.\nBefore Trump took office, the Chinese government was far outspending the U.S. in the development of the types of artificial intelligence with benefits for espionage and security. According to In-Q-Tel, an investment arm of the United States intelligence community, the U.S. government spent an estimated $1.2 billion on unclassified A.I. programs in 2016. The Chinese government, in its current five-year plan, has committed a hundred and fifty billion dollars to A.I.\nThe Trump Administration’s proposed 2018 budget would cut scientific research by fifteen per cent, or $11.1 billion. That includes a ten-per-cent decrease in the National Science Foundation’s spending on “intelligent systems.” In November, Eric Schmidt, then the chairman of Alphabet, told the Artificial Intelligence & Global Security Summit, in Washington, that reductions in the funding of basic-science research will help China overtake the U.S. in artificial intelligence within a decade. “By 2020, they will have caught up. By 2025, they will be better than us. By 2030, they will dominate the industries of A.I.,” he said. Schmidt, who chairs the Defense Innovation Advisory Board, added that the ban on visitors from Iran was an obstacle to technology development. “Iran produces some of the top computer scientists in the world. I want them here. I want them working for Alphabet and Google. It’s crazy not to let these people in.”\nChina’s effort to extend its reach has been so rapid that it is fuelling a backlash. Australian media have uncovered efforts by China’s Communist Party to influence Australia’s government. In December, Sam Dastyari, a member of the Australian Senate, resigned after revelations that he warned one of his donors, a businessman tied to China’s foreign-influence efforts, that his phone was likely tapped by intelligence agencies. Australia’s Prime Minister, Malcolm Turnbull, announced a ban on foreign political donations, citing “disturbing reports about Chinese influence.”\nIn August, Cambridge University Press, in Britain, caused an uproar among scholars after it removed from one of its Chinese Web sites more than three hundred academic articles that mentioned sensitive topics, such as the crackdown at Tiananmen Square, in an effort to satisfy China’s censors. Cambridge abandoned the move. (Another academic publisher, Springer Nature, defended its decision to censor itself, saying that it was necessary “to prevent a much greater impact on our customers and authors.”)\nForeign governments and human-rights groups have expressed alarm that Beijing is pursuing critics beyond its borders and bringing them to mainland China for detention. One night last January, unidentified men escorted a Chinese-Canadian billionaire, Xiao Jianhua, from a Hong Kong hotel, in a wheelchair, with a sheet over his head. (His whereabouts are unknown.) In several cases, beginning in 2015, the publishers of books critical of China’s leaders were abducted from Hong Kong and Thailand, without public extradition procedures.\nAcross Asia, there is wariness of China’s intentions. Under the Belt and Road Initiative, it has loaned so much money to its neighbors that critics liken the debt to a form of imperialism. When Sri Lanka couldn’t repay loans on a deepwater port, China took majority ownership of the project, stirring protests about interference in Sri Lanka’s sovereignty. China also has a reputation for taking punitive economic action when a smaller country offends its politics. After the Nobel Prize was awarded to the dissident Liu Xiaobo, China stopped trade talks with Norway for nearly seven years; during a territorial dispute with the Philippines, China cut off banana imports; in a dispute with South Korea, it restricted tourism and closed Korean discount stores.\nIn Beijing’s political circles, some strategists worry that their leaders risk moving too fast to fill the void created by America’s withdrawal from its global role. I dropped by to see one of the city’s wisest observers of America, Jia Qingguo, the dean of the Department of Diplomacy at Peking University. “The U.S. is not losing leadership. You’re giving it up. You’re not even selling it,” he said. “It seems Donald Trump’s view is: if China can take a free ride, why can’t we? But the problem is that the U.S. is too big. If you ride for free, then the bus will collapse. Maybe the best solution is for China to help the U.S. drive the bus. The worse scenario is that China drives the bus when it’s not ready. It’s too costly and it doesn’t have enough experience.” Jia, who has a wry smile and a thick head of graying hair, said that universities have not had enough time to train scholars in areas that China is now expected to navigate: “In the past, the outside world was very far away. Now it’s very close. But the change happened too fast to digest.”\nJoseph Nye, the Harvard political scientist who coined the term “soft power,” to describe the use of ideas and attraction rather than force, told me that China has improved its ability to persuade—up to a point. “American soft power comes heavily from our civil society, everything from Hollywood to Harvard and the Gates Foundation,” he said. “China still doesn’t understand that. They still haven’t opened that up. I think that is going to hurt them in the longer term.” Nye predicts that Trump’s unpopularity will not erase America’s soft-power advantage, except under certain conditions. “Probably he won’t be seen as a turning point in American history but will be seen as a blip, another one of the strange characters that our political process throws up, like Joe McCarthy or George Wallace,” he said. “Two things could make me wrong. One is if he gets us into a major war. The second is if he gets reëlected and winds up doing damage to our checks and balances or our reputation as a democratic society. I don’t think those are likely, but I don’t have enough confidence in my judgment to assure you.”\nAt the White House, aides said that late last year a two-tiered strategy took hold, in which the President will seek to maintain congenial relations with Xi while lower-ranking officials introduce hard-line measures. By the end of 2017, the State Department, the National Security Council, and other agencies were considering policies to push back on China’s influence operations, trade practices, and efforts to shape the technology of the future. Michael Green, who was George W. Bush’s chief adviser on Asia, told me, “They’re looking at it like it’s a war plan: working with the allies, working with members of Congress.”\nIn its national-security strategy, the Administration suggested that, to stop the theft of trade secrets, it could restrict visas to foreigners who travel to the U.S. to study science, engineering, math, and technology; it dedicated itself to a “free and open Indo-Pacific,” which, in practice, will likely expand military coöperation with India, Japan, and Australia. Robert Lighthizer, the U.S. Trade Representative, is considering several potential tariffs in order to punish China for its alleged theft of intellectual property and dumping of exports on U.S. markets. “We’re not looking for a trade war,” a senior White House official involved in China issues told me. “But the President fully believes that we have to stand up to China’s predatory industrial policies that have hollowed out U.S. manufacturing and, increasingly, high-tech sectors.”\nIf the White House takes such actions, they could collide with Trump’s admiring relationship with Xi. In the meantime, many China specialists describe the Administration’s approach as inchoate. In the first eleven months of Trump’s Presidency, none of his Cabinet secretaries had given a major speech on China. The post of Assistant Secretary of State for East Asian and Pacific Affairs, the State Department’s top job for the region—once held by W. Averell Harriman, Richard Holbrooke, and Christopher Hill—remained unfilled. David Lampton, the director of China studies at the School of Advanced International Studies, at Johns Hopkins, told me, “I think this is like a bunch of drunks in a car fighting for the steering wheel.”\nIn dozens of interviews in China and the U.S., I encountered almost no one who expects China to supplant the U.S. anytime soon in its role as the world’s preëminent power. Beyond China’s economic obstacles, its political system—including constraints on speech, religion, civil society, and the Internet—drives away some of the country’s boldest and most entrepreneurial thinkers. Xi’s system inspires envy from autocrats, but little admiration from ordinary citizens around the world. And for all of Xi’s talk of a “Chinese solution,” and the glorious self-portrait in “Wolf Warrior II,” China has yet to mount serious responses to global problems, such as the refugee crisis or Syria’s civil war. Global leadership is costly; it means asking your people to contribute to others’ well-being, to send young soldiers to die far from home. In 2015, when Xi pledged billions of dollars in loan forgiveness and additional aid for African nations, some in China grumbled that their country was not yet rich enough to do that. China is not “seeking to replace us in the same position as a kind of chairman of planet Earth,” Daniel Russel said. “They have no intention of emulating the U.S. as a provider of global goods or as an arbiter who teases out universal principles and common rules.”\nMore likely, the world is entering an era without obvious leaders, an “age of nonpolarity,” as Richard Haass, the president of the Council on Foreign Relations, has described it, in which nationalist powers—China, the U.S., Russia—contend with non-state groups of every moral stripe, from Doctors Without Borders to Facebook, and ExxonMobil to Boko Haram. It is natural for Americans to mourn that prospect, but Shivshankar Menon, India’s former foreign secretary, suspects that the U.S. will retain credibility and leadership. “The U.S. is the only power that I know of which is capable of turning on a dime, with a process of self-examination,” he said. “Within two years of entering Iraq, there were people within the system saying, ‘Are we doing the right thing?’ ” He has seen the country recover before: “Three times just in my lifetime. I was in the U.S. in ’68, on the West Coast. I’ve seen what the U.S. did in the eighties to reinvent itself. What it did after 2008 is remarkable. For me, this comes and goes. The U.S. can afford it.”\nMenon continued, “I think we’re going back to actually the historic norm, separate multiverses, rather than one, which was an exception. If you go back to the concept of Europe in the nineteenth century, people basically lived in different worlds and had very controlled interactions with each other. China is not going to take responsibility for everything that happens in the Middle East or South America.” In small ways, Menon said, we live this way already. “Technology has made it easy, because iTunes keeps selling you more of the same music—it doesn’t keep exposing you to something new. When you go to Beijing, you still listen to your own music, and you’re actually in your own bubble. So it’s a historical aberration and a rarity, where you say you’re ‘globalized.’ But what does that mean?”\nLate one afternoon in November, I went to see a professor in Beijing who has studied the U.S. for a long time. America’s recent political turmoil has disoriented him. “I’m struggling with this a lot,” he said, and poured me a cup of tea. “I love the United States. I used to think that the multiculturalism of the U.S. might work here. But, if it doesn’t work there, then it won’t work here.” In his view, the original American bond is dissolving. “In the past, you kept together because of common values that you call freedom,” he said. Emerging in its place is a cynical, zero-sum politics, a return to blood and soil, which privileges interests above inspiration.\nIn that sense, he observed, the biggest surprise in the relationship between China and the United States is their similarity. In both countries, people who are infuriated by profound gaps in wealth and opportunity have pinned their hopes on nationalist, nostalgic leaders, who encourage them to visualize threats from the outside world. “China, Russia, and the U.S. are moving in the same direction,” he said. “They’re all trying to be great again.” ♦\nEvan Osnos joined The New Yorker as a staff writer in 2008, and covers politics and foreign affairs.

{"title": "Exclusive: Chinese exporters concerned about US-China trade spat ...", "author": "Reuters", "pub_time": "2018年4月17日", "url": "https://uk.reuters.com/article/us-china-trade-cantonfair-exclusive/exclusive-chinese-exporters-concerned-about-us-china-trade-spat-survey-idUKKBN1HO1CH", "content": "5 Min Read\nGUANGZHOU, China (Reuters) - As Washington and Beijing face off in a simmering trade dispute, Chinese exporters are expressing concerns about an escalation, although many say they expect the worst to be averted as negotiations continue.\nIn a survey of 135 Chinese exporters, including 84 from the Canton Trade Fair, China’s largest, and 51 from an electronics event in Hong Kong, 65 percent expressed some “worries” about a trade war.\nBut only 26 percent expected a “full-blown” trade war to play out as negotiators on the Chinese and U.S. sides draw up tariff lists that currently stand to affect some $100 billion in goods on both sides.\n“The thunder is very loud,” said Stephen Chow, a senior manager at Provision, a flat-screen television maker from Guangzhou. “But the raindrops may be very small.” He added: “things won’t end up as severely as they say now.”\nWith only Chinese factories with business in the United States in certain targeted categories likely to be directly affected by the tariffs, there was more a sense of foreboding than outright panic on Monday, with the halls at the fair teeming with buyers.\nThe survey conducted by Reuters showed that Chinese exporters are more preoccupied with production costs, new orders and currency issues rather than fears of growing trade protectionism.\nWhile trade fairs have proliferated across China in recent years, alongside online platforms like Alibaba, the biannual Canton Trade Fair is still unsurpassed in scale.\nThe fair lures more Chinese manufacturers and foreign buyers than other rivals, serving as a barometer on China’s export sector that accounts for around 18 percent of the country’s gross domestic product. The Hong Kong electronics trade fair is one of the biggest in the region.\nWhile some three-quarters of exporters said they had dealings with the United States, 46 percent said they expected “no change” to their businesses this year as a result of the trade spat, while around a quarter expected a dip.\nThe manufacturers surveyed at the Canton Fair included those in affected sectors like LED lighting, machinery, auto parts and electronics. STOCKPILING KEY COMPONENTS\nSome who do envisage an impact, like China’s LED lighting makers, whose products could be slapped with a 25 percent tariff, say extra costs have already rippled into supply chains.\nBenson Ho, the boss of an LED plant in the southern city of Foshan, said the stockpiling of things like the semiconductor chips needed for his LED products had already driven up some chip prices by around 10 percent.\nSimilar stockpiling has been taking place for heat-conducting materials made by firms including Dow Corning of the United States and Japan’s Shi-Etsu, he said.\n“50 percent of the chips we use are from the U.S. because the ones made in China are very poor, so we’ve been forced to pay more for these,” Ho said at his stall. “People are buying these chips like stocks, speculating the price will go up.”\nHe said that he thought the United States had an advantage in the dispute. “They’re fighting with technology, but we’re just fighting with our muscles, with labor. So the impact on us will be very great.”\nAs a possible mitigating measure, four of five exporters surveyed said they would try to reduce their reliance on the United States by seeking new business in regions including Europe, Central and South America, and the Middle East.\nBut an overwhelming majority - 93 percent - said they wouldn’t consider shifting production out of China for now.\nOf those polled, 72 percent said they thought Beijing should allow the yuan to depreciate, making their goods more competitive.\nSuch a move would likely be frowned upon by U.S. President Donald Trump. On Monday, he accused China and Russia of “playing the Currency Devaluation game”.\nBalazs Kovacs, a buyer from Hungary looking for electrical heating equipment, said his business wasn’t affected directly, but a worsening trade standoff could eventually weigh on the entire global economy, posing a longer term threat.\nTrevor Sisco, the vice president of Global Retail Partner, whose company sources products like drones, TV wall-mounts and walkie-talkies for U.S. retail giants including Walmart and Best Buy, said aggressive posturing on both sides could lead to an expansion of tariffs into other more mainstream household products.\n“You’ve got a manufacturing nation and a consumer nation. So if you start a trade war between the two of them, at the end of the day the consumer nation is the one that’s going to pay the price, because they’re the one buying it.”\nHe added: “The cost is always going to go to the consumer.”\n(For a graphic on 'Canton Fair survey' click here)\nAdditional reporting by Wyman Ma and Sam Vadas; Tina Ge and Alexis Tan in Hong Kong; Editing by Philip McClellan\nAll quotes delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.

The city has become a second home for Kenyan entrepreneurs,\" said the cabin crew as she boarded the 11 pm plane to Guangzhou.\nAnd this is evident by the adverts placed on local dailies inviting entrepreneurs wishing to travel to the big city. The entrepreneurs are offered subsidized costs in hotel books and air ticket on a first come basis.\nXinhua caught up with Dinah Konzole, a Kenyan entrepreneur on her way to the Jomo Kenyatta International Airport rushing to book the last flight to China on a Wednesday evening.\nKonzole, an entrepreneur who owns one of the largest boutique (beauty shop) in Kenya said she never misses to travel to the big city once or twice a month.\n\"I'm a frequenter flier.

You set up a business, it catches up very fast so long you establish your relations with the good hearted people around here,\" Riungu said in an recent interview with Xinhua.\nSome other Kenyan business entrepreneurs have come together to mobilize funds for air tickets and hotel bookings to enable them to attend business seminars and import goods as well.\nThe team of 27 businessmen and women who are dealers in construction materials and furniture shops said they have a joint account in which they make deposits every month to enable them to attend the seminars annually.\n\"The seminars open our mind to think globally and make the right decisions in our business. Last year we attend the China-Africa business summit held in Guangzhou which brought all business people across the world. It was an opportunity for us to network and even sign big business deals,\" said Joakim Olando, an entrepreneur based in Kenya.\n"}

Robbins said it's somewhere between his 16th and 18th trip to China in the past five years.\nHis frequent travel across the Pacific Ocean is indicative of an evolving relationship between Cisco and the world's second-largest economy. China has long presented a challenge to U.S. technology companies, due to the country's rigid control over internet content and its favorable treatment of domestic vendors.\nIn 2013, Cisco was among a number of large American companies essentially blacklisted by China after the revelations from National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden that the U.S. was spying on foreign governments.\n\"We have seen gradual improvements over there over the last couple years,\" Robbins told CNBC on Monday, before taking the stage at the annual shareholders meeting in San Jose, California. \"There are no shortcuts in China. You have to invest the time there and you have to build the relationships there and understand the market.\"\nRobbins, a Cisco veteran of two decades, was head of global sales until mid-2015, when he succeeded John Chambers as CEO. Chambers held the role of chairman until Monday.\nRobbins has overseen a rally in the stock of late. The shares have jumped 26 percent in the past four months to $37.96, the highest since 2001 and the dot-com crash.\nWhile Robbins has stoked investor excitement by building the company's subscription software business, in part through acquisitions, and notching key partnerships with the likes of Google, Cisco has been shrinking for two years. And for fiscal 2018, analysts are only projecting sales growth of about 1 percent, according to Thomson Reuters.\nBut Robbins doesn't want you to see Cisco as a legacy enterprise tech company sitting on a mountain of cash ($71.6 billion as of October). Rather, for an indication of Cisco's place in the future, he'll tell you to look at places like China.\nCisco, which became one of the world's biggest businesses by selling switches and routers that direct internet traffic, is providing the infrastructure for so-called smart cities. In addition to speaking at the World Internet Conference, Robbins was in China last week for the groundbreaking of the country's second smart city, this one in Huizhou in the Guangdong province.\nNew integrated traffic and parking systems, connected lighting and a future of autonomous driving are all part of the vision for these new cities that are being developed in China, India, Saudi Arabia and elsewhere.\n\"These are literally greenfield cities that are being built,\" Robbins said. Cisco is the \"backbone and infrastructure provider, all the way up through the data management layer,\" he said.\nIn his many trips to China, Robbins said he's realized that relationships there are built on the provincial level, working with government and business leaders on the ground.\n\"The provinces are, in many cases, like countries,\" he said.\nAs promising as these new cities may be for Cisco to test networking technologies and erect large infrastructure projects, Robbins has to deal with the very real threat the changing computing landscape poses to his company's core business.\nIt's no secret that companies are moving data and workloads out of their own data centers and into the cloud. Amazon Web Services is hosting an increasing amount of this data, but so are Microsoft and Google. That all adds up to fewer companies buying big Cisco boxes.\nCisco is looking for ways to not only play in the cloud but to have a central role in its growth. Robbins sees security technology as one major place for Cisco to win business — protecting data across mobile devices, various clouds, traditional data centers and a host of new microservices.\nHe's also forging partnerships. In October, Cisco signed a deal with Google that will combine Google's data center and software expertise with Cisco's global salesforce and security. The idea for Cisco is to help its customers migrate to the cloud and navigate multiple clouds before businesses find other vendors to do it for them.\nIt was a marquee announcement for Cisco and got investors wondering if similar deals may be coming with other cloud providers.\nRobbins isn't ready to announce anything, but when asked on Monday if we can assume more such tie-ups are in the works, he offered a two-word reply: \"That's fair.\"\n\nPlaying\nShare this video...\nWatch Next...\n"}

{"title": "Commentary: What Jack Ma Can Teach All of Us About the Key to ...", "author": "Fortune", "pub_time": "2017年12月22日", "url": "http://fortune.com/2017/12/22/fortune-global-forum-alibaba-jack-ma-business-success/", "content": "I was fortunate to attend the Fortune Global Forum in Guangzhou, China earlier this month and, as I reflected on the many high-level discussions that took place around the theme of “Openness and Innovation: Shaping the Global Economy,” it occurred to me that the discussions began to share a common idea: that in order to progress the way we do business and interact together, we must first and foremost be inclusive.\nGone are the days where companies grow in isolation in their own industry, watching competitors from afar and trying to out-hire, out-produce, and out-expand them. To be successful now, companies must take an approach that connects people, ideas, and opportunities from all sides. In other words, the key to success today is being inclusive—which means bringing together a diverse leadership and workforce to promote and encourage a range of thoughts and ideas that could propel the company forward in a new way.\nIt also means being inclusive with customers, creating a two-way dialogue and enabling customers to be a part of solutions. And it means, ironically, inclusion with competitors—not just learning from them, but creating opportunities to partner and work together to create circumstances that benefit the consumer (and the world), not just the business.\nThere were many conversations at the Fortune Global Forum that underscored this way of thinking. Below are a few ways I believe organizations can create a more inclusive model, and strengthen their business by expanding their ability to connect and include others in the process:\nWhen we think about an inclusive mindset, it goes for including people in that vision as much as it does technology. Jack Ma, founder of the Asian e-commerce powerhouse Alibaba (BABA), said it best during the forum when he said, “As a business, it’s not about empowering ourselves. It’s about the legacy we leave to the world for human beings.” And, while artificial intelligence will be a part of that legacy, he noted during a discussion with Alan Murray, president of Fortune and chief content officer of Time Inc, that, at the end of the day, we need to “make sure that machine learning is improving human lives.”\nThat means understanding that, while human beings will benefit from technology, it will take people to understand the value of decisions and the impact they will have on others. He then coined the term “LQ” (“love quotient”) in discussing that people will always win over computers, as computers can have high IQ (intelligence quotient), i.e., learn and not forget, but they will not be able to master EQ (“emotional quotient”) or LQ—all ultimately critical to success.\nHaving an inclusive mindset means thinking about and looking at competition differently. First, the lines of competitors have become increasingly blurry, with technology at the center of nearly every business, and companies competing with those they never before had considered (i.e., Amazon (AMZN)). New categories are also being defined, such as “mobility” rather than “automotive” and “airline.”\nSecond, when businesses think inclusively, they start to look across industries for opportunities to partner, align, and grow stronger, filling in their gaps. As Erik Fyrwald, CEO of Swiss agricultural group Syngenta International, commented at the Fortune Global Forum, “Look at who is best these days and aim to work with them.” This means looking vertically and horizontally, not just at what is right in front of you.\n“Diversity is and must be a source of strength,” said Justin Trudeau, Canadian prime minister, during his discussion with Nancy Gibbs of Time. He went on to talk about how important it is to have a diverse bench of leadership to ensure more sound decision-making, rather than having one person from the “diverse group” represent his or her entire population.\nTrudeau added that it’s a mistake to “lock someone into a representative narrative,” and that leadership should aim to “have people share a full range of experiences” from diverse populations if they want to open their capacity to be truly creative. He went on to say that diversity of thought, experiences, and approaches were essential for organizations to be able to respond to a rapidly shifting world.\nAs discussed at the Fortune Global Forum, the future of technology, AI, mobility, and a changing workforce are all important components of innovation and the progression of our society. But my biggest takeaway was that none of these advancements will be successful in the long run if done without inclusion. Openness leads to innovation, and we cannot be innovative in the products we make, the approach we take to business, or the way we work and live if we operate in isolation.\nI am looking forward to seeing how this inclusive mindset continues to grow and play out across leadership and business strategy—especially as we look into the new year toward Davos, which will focus on strengthening global cooperation and inclusivity across regions and industries, as well as how organizations communicate differently with customers to empower those around them to be agents of the change, not merely products of it.\nKathy Bloomgarden is CEO of Ruder Finn.\n"}

Possible retaliation ranges from a sell-off of US Treasuries to a devaluation of the Chinese currency.\nBut Li Yang, a senior economic adviser to the Chinese leadership and the head of the National Institute for Finance and Development, an official think tank, told the Boao Forum for Asia on Monday that China was unlikely to use financial means to tackle its trade disputes partly because Beijing had more tolerance for trade losses.\nLi said China was in good shape to withstand hits from US President Donald Trump’s trade actions because net exports played only a marginal role in China’s overall economy compared to domestic consumption and investment.\nA trade war “would not carry a significant blow” to China, he said.\n“We would definitely have losses, but the negative impact on our economy would not be that big,” Li, a former member of China’s monetary policy committee, said.\nAs such, there was no reason for Beijing to up the ante and complicate the situation with exchange rate warfare, he said.\nAnd while Chinese state media outlets have ramped up their rhetoric on the dispute, neither country has yet imposed punitive tariffs. Trump also appeared to soften his tone on Sunday, tweeting that China would “take down” its trade barriers and “a deal will be made” on intellectual property.\nSheng Songcheng, a former central bank statistics chief and now a counsellor at the People’s Bank of China, agreed that there was more to lose than gain from devaluing the yuan.\nFinancial News, the central bank’s official newspaper, quoted Sheng as saying that devaluation could speed up capital outflows and was not needed to spur exports.\nCan China play the globalisation card to win ‘trade war’ allies in Europe?\nTu Guangshao, president of China Investment Corp, said the sovereign wealth fund still wanted to expand its direct investment in the US.\n“Of course I want to increase China Investment Corporation’s direct investment in the US and I have stated my attitude clearly,” he said in Boao.\nAdding his voice to the chorus against broader retaliation, Zhang Yuyan, director of the Institute of World Economics and Politics under the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, said China must “draw a line” between financial and trade issues.\n“Selling forex reserves is a financial issue,” Zhang said.\n“The market is worried that China might have a massive sell-off of US Treasuries, and this could push up US interest rates and spill over into the rest of the world. But I think that’s a small likelihood and should be separated from the trade issue.”\nZhang said trade-linked uncertainty over the yuan’s future would persist until the issue was settled.\n“The decision makers, government officials and scholars from the two countries all know that if a trade war does start between the two, there is no winner – only losers,” Zhang said. “I’m an optimist and believe the two countries will manage to find a solution through negotiation [before the US tariff deadline].”\nAn escalation in trade tensions between China and the US could also be risky for other economies in Asia because many are links in supply chains for goods destined for the US, according Fan Gang, president of the Shenzhen-based China Development Institute.\nTrump softens on China as Beijing ramps up rhetoric in show of toughness over trade spat\n“China’s exported goods contain lots of imports from other Asian countries ... Those parts are assembled in China. For example, an iPhone is sold for US$1,000, but China only adds US$50-100 of the value,” said Fan, who sits on the central bank’s monetary policy committee. “Disputes between China and the US could disrupt the whole chain of trade.”\nAdditional reporting by Grace Tsoi\nYou are signed up.

The extremely benign global economic backdrop, coupled with the persistence of ultra-low bond yields despite the beginning of the withdrawal of monetary stimulus, have driven valuations in debt and equity markets to record highs. This has desensitised international investors to a plethora of financial and geopolitical risks.\nMichael Corbat, the head of Citigroup, put it succinctly when he said on a panel at Davos that “there is a numbness out there that’s concerning. When the next [major sell-off] comes – and it will come – it’s likely to be more violent than it would otherwise be if we let some pressure off along the way.”\nMake no mistake, the Davos elite see the writing on the wall.\nThe stronger the momentum behind the rally and the loftier the returns on assets, the greater the risk that a major correction will occur. Goldman Sachs threw these dangers into sharp relief on Monday when it published a note showing that risk appetite around the world has risen to its strongest level since 1991.\nThe “numbness” that Corbat and other executives attending Davos are worried about is evident in the degree to which assets have become mispriced. While there are many examples of this, the ones which stand out, and are most worrying, are the following:\nEuropean debt: On Wednesday, the publication of a purchasing managers’ index survey by IHS Markit showed that the euro-zone economy is now growing at its fastest clip in 12 years, with European firms recruiting staff at the briskest pace since 2000 and price pressures running at their highest for seven years. Yet monetary policy is still being run as if Europe’s economy was suffering a depression.\nThe yield on German two-year bonds remains deep in negative territory even though Germany’s economy is expanding at its fastest pace in six years. More worryingly, nearly a third of euro-zone bonds are negative-yielding, according to an index compiled by JPMorgan, including the 2-year debt of Italy, the bloc’s most vulnerable economy. This is deeply alarming. The shift towards tighter monetary policy in the euro zone could well lead to a bloodbath in European debt.\nJunk bonds: An even more egregious case of mispricing is in the high-yield, or “junk”, bond market. When sales of sub-investment grade US corporate debt enjoy their strongest start to the year since 2014, helping push down spreads (or the risk premium) to their lowest levels since 2007 in the face of a tightening in US monetary policy, it is clear that “irrational exuberance” has taken hold.\nIn a sign of the scale of the mispricing in the junk bond market, the average yield on European high-yield bonds fell below the 2 per cent barrier in November for the first time, even dropping below the yield on benchmark 10-year Treasury bonds.\nThis shows that investors have stopped discriminating between risky corporate bonds and the supposedly risk-free debt of the US government.\nVolatility trade: The most blatant case of mispricing in markets is the volatility trade. Hundreds of billions of dollars are backing bets that volatility in equity markets will continue to remain subdued. The “short volatility” trade now amounts to a staggering US$2 trillion, according to a report by Artemis Capital Management.\nWhile betting against volatility has proved extremely profitable over the past couple of years, the “short-vol” trade is feeding on itself, exacerbating vulnerabilities in markets so that when volatility finally does erupt – which it inevitably will at some point – the sell-off will be that much more disorderly.

It is the perfect occasion for such a pronouncement; the annual gathering of government leaders, business titans and entrepreneurs in the Hainan town has arguably surpassed the importance of its European counterpart in the Swiss resort of Davos, the World Economic Forum.\nComing as trade tensions between China and the United States rush towards a full-blown war, investors and those with financial clout will be closely watching what is said. Measures proving the nation’s commitment to opening up and increasing foreign access to its markets would garner global plaudits.\nIs Xi Jinping set to announce plans to transform ‘China’s Hawaii’ into the new Hong Kong?\nThere is much speculation as to what Xi will announce. He used his speech at the forum in 2015 to promote two of his most important strategies, the “Belt and Road Initiative” and the idea of a shared destiny for the world. The establishment of free-trade ports with greater freedom for policymaking than existing free-trade zones is tipped to be one of the major revelations.\nXi foreshadowed a deepening of reforms at the 19th Communist Party Congress last November. Premier Li Keqiang and Vice-Premier Liu He have spoken of China needing to protect its interests and guard against risks, obvious references to the tactics of US president Donald Trump, the poster child of the anti-globalisation movement. But the looming trade war with China he launched is just the backdrop for the long-term changes that Chinese leaders have to make to strengthen the nation’s economy and make it more resilient to external influences.\nThe 40th anniversary of China’s reforms and opening up is the right occasion to unveil bold measures needed to take the nation to its next stage of development. Liu, Xi’s top economics adviser, gave a taste at Davos in January, saying that there would be further economic liberalisation, alignment with the global rules of trade, increased market access, expansion of the services sector and creation of a welcoming environment for investors. Li, in his annual work report to the National People’s Congress last month, gave examples of some of the markets to be targeted, listing telecommunications, health care and education. What has so far been lacking, though, are the specifics.\nChina’s central bank chief Zhou Xiaochuan ‘headed for Boao Forum’, Asia’s Davos\nCommentators have long compared the Boao Forum to that in Davos and the former is now often referred to as the World Economic Forum of Asia. But given Asia is the world’s engine and driver of growth and key decision-makers gather at Boao each year, it would seem to have greater clout. Understandably, given the uncertainty to the global economy, hopes are pinned on Xi to lay out a means of assuring continued development and prosperity.\nYou are signed up.

Chief Content Officer and Fortune Editor-in-Chief Alan Murray at a press conference in Davos, Switzerland. This major event will bring together CEOs from the world’s biggest companies—the Fortune Global 500—with leaders from China in both business and government.\n\nIn addition, Fortune announced the theme of this year’s Fortune Global Forum: “Openness and Innovation: Shaping the Global Economy.” The program will focus on the key issues facing multinational companies at a time of significant developments in the global economy and in China, which will hold its 19th CPC National Congress during the second half of 2017.\n“Every major multinational company is paying close attention to China’s development at a time when global trade policies are being reshaped,” said Murray. “For companies that operate on a worldwide basis and rely on open markets, there’s a lot at stake.”\nThis event will be the fifth Fortune Global Forum to be held in China. At a press conference in September announcing Guangzhou as the 2017 location, Fortune cited Guangzhou’s reputation as a business-friendly city, one that has established economic and trade relationships with more than 200 countries and regions on five continents. Guangzhou has announced significant new initiatives to facilitate investment promotion and business development, building on its history as an international center of trade. According to the city's 13th five-year development plan, which covers 2016-2020, Guangzhou will establish hubs for international shipping, aviation, science and technology innovation by 2020. More than half the Fortune Global 500 companies have already made investments in or set up operations in Guangzhou, with potential for continued expansion.\nFortune also noted that as the capital city of Guangdong Province, now China’s most populous province, Guangzhou is an attractive destination for multinational companies. Other factors include Guangzhou’s strategic position on the Maritime Silk Road and its participation in the Guangdong Free Trade Zone, which is of special interest to companies in many fields, including finance, shipping, high tech, manufacturing and logistics. Another driver in the selection of Guangzhou for the Fortune Global Forum is its position as the biggest city and largest port in the Pearl River Delta. A 2015 World Bank Group report found that the Pearl River Delta has overtaken Tokyo to become the world’s largest urban area in both size and population. More people live in the region than the countries of Argentina, Australia, Canada and Malaysia. The area has been characterized as an epicenter of the Chinese boom.\nSince 1995, the Fortune Global Forum has convened world leaders and the heads of global business—the chairmen, presidents and CEOs of many of the world’s largest companies—on the dynamic frontiers of international commerce. Participation in the Fortune Global Forum is by invitation only and expected guests will include multinational CEOs and the heads of some of China’s most important companies, along with world leaders. Participants in previous Global Forums have included former PRC Presidents Jiang Zemin and Hu Jintao, Vice Premiers Wang Qishan and Zhang Gaoli; former U.S. Presidents Bill Clinton and George H.W. Bush; and company chairmen Richard Branson of Virgin Group, Jamie Dimon of J.P. Morgan Chase, Ginni Rometty of IBM, Victor Fung of Li & Fung Ltd., Robert Iger of The Walt Disney Company, Chanda Kochhar of ICICI Bank, Yang Yuanqing of Lenovo, Jack Ma of Alibaba, Frederick W. Smith of FedEx, Zhang Ruimin of Haier and Robin Li of Baidu. The 2016 Global Forum was held in Rome last month and included the participation of His Holiness Pope Francis.\nIn a congratulatory message read at the opening dinner at the 2013 Fortune Global Forum, which was held in Chengdu, President Xi Jinping called the event “one of the most influential forums on economic development in the world.” A press release issued at the time by the government of Sichuan Province announced that Chengdu signed 74 investment projects during the 2013 Forum with Fortune Global 500 companies from both China and around the world, with a total investment of 112 billion yuan (US $18.3 billion).\nFortune is a global leader in business journalism with major franchises that include the Fortune 500 and the Fortune 100 Best Companies to Work For.

Since 2010, only two real estate companies - China Merchants Shekou Holdings and Future Land Holdings Group - successfully listed in the A-share market in Dec, 2015.\nMedia previously reported that the deal may mark a step closer for Wanda Commercial to relist on the mainland and cash in on higher valuations on domestic markets after it delisted in Hong Kong last year.\nHowever, 21st Century Business Herald said it may be difficult for Wanda Commercial to give up its \"real estate\" tag.\nEven after some hotels and tourism projects are sold, Wanda Commercial still owns many Wanda Plaza in China. In its prospectus, the company said it is world's second-largest commercial property owners and domestic largest shopping center and luxury hotel owner.\nAlso, Wanda Commercial is identified as a real estate enterprise, according to the latest IPO lineup information.\n"}

He has also threatened to scrap Obama’s nuclear deal with Iran unless it’s thoroughly revised, an approach the Israeli leader staunchly supports.\nIran is certain to be the top subject in today’s meeting. Earlier this month Trump issued an ultimatum to other world powers that are party to the Iran nuclear agreement, saying that he won’t continue to waive sanctions lifted under the deal unless it’s revised, giving the other signatories less than four months to resolve the dispute.\n\nNetanyahu told German Chancellor Angela Merkel in Davos yesterday that the only way to fix the nuclear deal “is to insert real, not cosmetic, fixes that will prevent Iran’s nuclearisation.”\nIf Trump decides to abandon the agreement, “then we will back you all the way,” Netanyahu said in the meeting.\nEuropean leaders have made clear they believe Iran is abiding by limits on its nuclear programme set out in the deal.\nTrump and Netanyahu are also likely to discuss the US peace effort, which a White House official said earlier this week had hit “a bump” after Palestinian leaders shunned American envoys in protest of Trump’s Jerusalem announcement. The White House still plans to unveil a plan in 2018 that will encompass broader regional diplomatic efforts that include Egypt, Jordan and Saudi Arabia.\nTrump told Netanyahu that Israel “will pay for” his Jerusalem announcement, an apparent acknowledgement that the Jewish State would have to make a concession in peace talks. Netanyahu said that Trump’s decision on Jerusalem “pushes peace forward.”\nthis story contains additional reporting by Agence France-Presse.\nYou are signed up. We think you'd also like\n"}

Außerdem kritisiert er das Parteiensystem in Deutschland.\nBeitrag weitersagen\nPermalink: http://www.faz.net/-hod-96gh9\nDer Milliardär George Soros hat am Rande des Weltwirtschaftsforums in Davos ein düsteres Bild der Zukunft gemalt. Der 87 Jahre alte berühmte Finanzinvestor sieht die Gefahr eines Atomkriegs, warnt vor den Folgen des Klimawandels, ist alarmiert über die Macht der Internetkonzerne und erklärt das europäische Parteiensystem für reformbedürftig. Bei seinem alljährlichen Dinner in dem Schweizer Skiort warnte der Investor, „Facebook und Google“ seien „immer mächtiger werdende Monopole“, die geneigt sein könnten, sich „mit autoritären Regimen“ zu verbünden.\nDer Investor zog dabei einen Vergleich mit Überwachungsstaat-Szenarien aus der Science-Fiction-Literatur: Die Internet-Giganten könnten „ein totalitäres Netzwerk schaffen, wie es Aldous Huxley und George Orwell sich nicht besser hätten ausmalen können“, sagte er in Anspielung auf die Romane „Schöne neue Welt“ und „1984“. Als rettenden Engel gegen die Macht der Internet-Giganten stellte Soros, der sich mehr Regeln für die Konzerne wünscht, die EU-Wettbewerbskommissarin Margrethe Vestager dar. Soros' Zuhörer waren derweil eifrig damit beschäftigt, die Äußerungen des Gastgebers in sozialen Netzwerken zu teilen.\nHinsichtlich der Krise in Europa nannte er explizit die CSU als Problemfall. Das Auftauchen einer anderen Partei – der AfD – habe die CSU gezwungen, „noch weiter nach rechts zu rücken angesichts der Wahlen in Bayern im kommenden Jahr“, sagte Soros. Dadurch habe sich zwischen den bislang wie siamesische Zwillinge agierenden Unionsparteien ein unüberbrückbarer Graben aufgetan. „Das deutsche Parteiensystem ist damit weitgehend funktionsunfähig, bis sich CDU und CSU aufspalten.“\nDer Milliardär ist scharfzüngiger Kritiker vieler Regierungen, allen voran der amerikanischen Führung von Donald Trump. „In den Vereinigten Staaten würde Präsident Trump gerne einen Mafia-Staat errichten, aber er schafft es nicht. Die Verfassung, andere Institutionen und die lebendige Zivilgesellschaft stehen dem entgegen“, sagte Soros. „Doch nicht nur das Überleben der offenen Gesellschaft steht auf dem Spiel, sondern der Zivilisation insgesamt.“ Der Grund sei der Aufstieg von Herrschern wie Kim Jong Un in Nordkorea und eben Trump in den Vereinigten Staaten. „Beide scheinen einen Atomkrieg in Kauf zu nehmen, um an der Macht zu bleiben.“ Allerdings betrachte er die Trump-Regierung als „zwischenzeitliches Phänomen“, das spätestens 2020 ende. „Oder sogar früher.“\nMehr zum Thema\n1/\nTrump in Davos : „Ich möchte einen starken Dollar sehen“\nWeltwirtschaftsforum in Davos : Trump sucht Nähe zu May\nDigitalisierungs-Wettstreit : Chinas Überwachungsapp drängt in die Welt\nKommentar : Mehr Datenschutz – aber nicht für alle\nOrbáns Hochschulgesetz : Eine Universität in den Mühlen der Politik\nSoros kritisierte am Donnerstag auch die Kryptowährung Bitcoin, die im vergangenen Jahr einen Hype erlebt hatte. „Das ist keine Währung“, sagte er.

China saw 7.98 million SUVs sold in the first 10 months this year, about 41 percent of total passenger car sales, and SUVs have been the sole growing segment, according to the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers.\n\"How quickly SUV demand in China is developing, I confess, is a little bit surprising to us, but we are now on the way,\" said Jochem Heizmann, head of Volkswagen Group China.\nThe Volkswagen brand, with its Tiguan already well sought after in the market, is planning to introduce at least 10 such models in the country by 2020.\nHeizmann said the first model from its third joint venture, JAC Volkswagen, will also be an electric SUV.\nCzech carmaker Skoda, a brand under Volkswagen AG, has unveiled its compact SUV Karoq at the auto show, which its China head Ralf Hanschen expects to further push the success story that its Kodiaq started.\nChina's SUV craze has not only taken aback Heizmann, but also Alan Batey, head of Chevrolet.\n\"We have not been fast enough to introduce a full SUV lineup, so 30 percent of our future products to be SUVs,\" Batey told China Daily on Friday. \"We clearly have a big opportunity with SUVs.\"\nThose who have already seized the opportunity, like Audi, are speeding up to introduce yet more models.\nAudi presented its Q8 concept on Thursday in Guangzhou, where its China head Joachim Wedler said the premium brand will launch six brand-new SUVs in China, including the Q8. Two of them are pure electric models.\nThe company has been localizing its Q5 and Q3 in China, some of the best-selling models in their respective segments.\nLincoln, which is the fastest-growing premium carmaker in China, has introduced all its SUVs into China, with the new full-sized Navigator unveiled on Friday as the latest addition.\nAmy Marentic, president of Lincoln Asia Pacific, expects SUVs' popularity to continue for another five to 10 years, with the segment's market share rising even higher.\n\"I believe it will be somewhere between 55 percent to 60 (in 10 years),\" said Marentic.\nModels from volume brands are even more welcome.\nLynk & Co, which unveiled its 01 SUV at the Guangzhou auto show, sold 6,000 vehicles in less than one hour.\nGreat Wall Motor's Wey, unveiled at last year's Guangzhou auto show, has proved to be a success story as the SUV producer's attempt to go up in the market. It came back this year with more SUV models. Borgward, one of the latest brands to hit China's market, has launched its 2018 version BX5, which is available in seven variants.\nElectrification drive\nCarmakers are starting to put greater emphasis on new energy cars, believing that China will take the lead worldwide.\nBMW is taking that one step further with the world premiere of the all-new BMW 5 Series plug-in hybrid in Guangzhou on Friday, produced by its Chinese venture BMW Brilliance in Shenyang, Liaoning province.\nWith the introduction of this car, the German brand will offer 6 new energy models. Following the BMW i3 and i8, BMW's electrification technology is extended to its core models, including the X1, X5 and the 7 Series plug-in-hybrid. Next year, Japanese premium brand Lexus will bring in two flagship models, the all-new Lexus LS and LC coupe, with only hybrid powertrain provided for Chinese customers who willingly contribute to the environment.\nBesides these two automakers, more international auto giants are now frequently employing hybrid powertrains with or without a charging plug, as they believe hybrid is a realistic solution towards an electrified future. They are convinced that hybrid powertrains are slashing emissions of carbon dioxide and pollutants, by cutting the average fuel consumption to one-digit liters per 100 kilometers.\nHowever, their Chinese peers are taking one step further to roll out fully electric products. They found it could be a critical opportunity to overtake the traditional giants, according to the experts gathered at the Global Future Mobility Forum in Hangzhou, Zhejiang province, days ahead of the auto show.\nChen Quanshi, a professor in automobile engineering at Tsinghua University, said the Chinese manufacturers of power batteries and electric motors are taking the lead, while European auto giants are maintaining their slow paces.\nHe said at the forum: \"Electrification is what is happening today. The country has the diligence to strengthen the e-vehicle industry, so the automotive companies will have to transition swiftly in the right direction.\" The Chinese auto manufacturing industry and carmakers have to open themselves up to embrace power and technologies from outside, to utilize each other's competitive advantages and to push forward development with an integrated approach, according to Zhang Yongwei, an official at the Development Research Center of the State Council.\nChen Qingtai, an automobile expert with the center, said a brighter electrification future would be forged via the joining of information technology companies including Alibaba Inc and Baidu Inc. \"We have strong advantages in both batteries and internet connectivity. If we seize the opportunities, the Chinese industry will be the future winner.\"\n"}

{"title": "Trump Says Getting Tough on Chinese Trade Will Empower the US ...", "author": "New York Times", "pub_time": "2018年3月22日", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/22/business/trade-trump-china.html", "content": "Advertisement\nSupported by\nBy Peter S. Goodman\nLONDON — In recent history as narrated by President Trump, the United States has been fleeced and humiliated by savvier nations unrestrained by naïve notions like global trading rules. Predatory powers have exploited American weakness to steal factory jobs, sowing despair.\nThe primary villain in this narrative is China, the country that Mr. Trump has placed at the center of the combative trade policy he is advancing. Steep tariffs on steel and aluminum set to take effect this week are portrayed as targeting China, even as they mostly hit other powers. In a broadening of the battle to electronics and clothing, the Trump administration is readying at least $50 billion worth of tariffs and penalties on imported Chinese goods.\nIf these demonstrations of muscle are intended to strengthen the American position in grappling with China, trade experts increasingly fret that Mr. Trump’s policies are doing the opposite: They potentially diminish the place of the United States in the world by alienating allies, undermining the potential for collective action among countries nursing shared grievances with China.\n“It’s going to be far more effective if they go together,” said Meredith Crowley, an expert on international trade at the University of Cambridge in England. “The fact that the United States is doing all of this alone, it does seem to be weakening the U.S. position.”\nChina’s staggering economic development has indeed been propelled by trading practices that exploit gaps in international rules or breach them outright. The Communist Party government still subsidizes key industries, lavishes credit on state-owned companies and imposes barriers against foreign competitors.\nIn many major economies, steel makers are contending with a glut of low-cost product, much of it made in China. Western businesses must acquiesce to Beijing’s wishes, sharing cutting-edge technology as a condition of entry to the Chinese marketplace. Frequently, the incoming technology is folded into Chinese goods that land on world markets, forcing innovators to compete against their own creations.\nThese problems are real and persistent. None are easily solved, despite the political appeal of vows to get tough with China.\nChina is an inextricable part of the global supply chain, producing the piece parts of cars, gadgets, bluejeans and practically anything else made by human hands. Its products — and, increasingly, its investment — are crucial components in every economy.\nGiven this, no single country has the power to force China to reform its ways, the thinking goes. China can get around tariffs in one nation by sending its wares elsewhere. It can buy its way into markets by wielding its largess, building infrastructure and proffering loans.\nMost experts assume that the only way to make progress in pressuring China to play fair is through collective action. Major economies must join forces, taking cases at the World Trade Organization and harmonizing their policies.\n“There are some grave concerns on China, who are massively subsidizing state-owned companies,” the European Union trade minister, Cecilia Malmstrom, said in January, on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. “And there, yes, we could work with the U.S.”\nYet Mr. Trump is pursuing the opposite course.\nIn one of his first acts as president, he renounced American participation in the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a trade bloc forged by the Obama administration in part as a counter to China’s rise. The pact included prohibitions on state subsidies, in what was supposed to be a template that could eventually influence China’s commercial realities.\nMr. Trump has also attacked the World Trade Organization — the linchpin of the global trading system and the ultimate venue for collective action — even suggesting that he might revoke American participation. In a formal statement to a congressional committee on Wednesday, a top White House trade official called the W.T.O. “wholly inadequate to deal with China’s version of a state-dominated economy that rejects market principles.”\nMr. Trump has, at least for now, exempted Canada and Mexico from the bite of his tariffs on steel and aluminum. But that is conditional on their satisfying his demands for sweetened terms in the renegotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement.\nOthers — Argentina, Australia, Brazil, the European Union and South Korea — have won a temporary reprieve. But they did so only after intense lobbying. Stalwart allies were reduced to effectively begging to be spared from an American offensive. It does not make for fertile conditions for coalition building.\n“It takes everybody’s eye off the real issue,” said Chad P. Bown, a trade expert at the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington. “Now, no one is talking about China’s overcapacity on steel. When you’re hitting the Europeans and the Japanese and the South Koreans on steel, how easy is it going to be for those countries to cooperate with you on forced technology transfers?”\n“You would need all of these countries to agree on these issues, which requires a tremendous amount of cooperation and trust,” he added. “And there’s such a dearth of that now.”\nMost fundamentally, Mr. Trump’s decision to cite a supposed threat to American national security as justification for the steel and aluminum tariffs has prompted allies to question the reliability of their friendship with the United States.\nChina produces only about 2 percent of the steel used in the United States, while Canada is the largest supplier. The national security justification for tariffs rests on the idea that metal is a building block of defense, and that America’s access is so imperiled that it must protect domestic suppliers.\nGiven that the United States already produces some two-thirds of the steel it uses, most economists dismiss that argument as absurd. In advancing it, they say, Mr. Trump risks dealing a real national security blow to the United States by threatening the durability of its alliances.\nJapan and Germany — two major steel producers — are home to American military bases. The vast majority of the European Union’s members belong to NATO. South Korea, another major source of steel, is key to the talks that Mr. Trump has said he intends to hold with North Korea to resolve the nuclear crisis.\n“It strikes me as not helpful to put these tariffs on metals against some of our most important military allies,” said Ms. Crowley, the Cambridge trade expert. “Trump is saying, ‘We can’t rely on you to provide high-grade steel in the event of a war.’ That is a very bizarre thing to say to an ally when you have military facilities in their countries. People there might wonder: What does the average American think of my country if their president is saying we can’t rely upon them?”\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nCollapse\nSEE MY OPTIONS\n"}

It is possible to be very successful in China. However, patience is required to understand the nuances of the environment and market,\" Laxton told Xinhua on Wednesday.\n\n\"The legal framework and judicial system is fair and actually works. In general, it has protected us when we required protection, which is encouraging for any foreign investor.\"\n\nFounded in 2004 in Johannesburg, South Africa, Laxton moved its Technology and Production Headquarters to Guangzhou in 2009, where its factory has 200 permanent employees. The multinational company is specialized in manufacturing self-service kiosk terminals for governments and corporations.\n\nLast year, the company obtained a high-tech firm certificate from the Guangdong provincial government.\n\n\"The Chinese government has business-friendly incentives and policies for high technology companies and is proactive and helpful,\" said Laxton. \"The supply chain in China supports our business and allows us to create and manufacture products that are competitive on a global stage.\"\n\nAccording to Laxton, southern China is without question the biggest electronics production hub in the world. Being positioned in this hub allows for an effective springboard into the global market.\n\nLaxton, who speaks Mandarin Chinese fluently and has led the company's expansion in China since 2009, spends a significant part of his time in Guangzhou every year.\n\n\"The spirit and energy of China and its people are unique and special. We are able to move at speeds that are truly unique to China,\" he said.\"Culturally, we have found the Chinese to be exceptionally respectful, humble, ambitious and supportive.\"\n\nRegarding cooperation among BRICS countries -- Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa -- Laxton suggested a transparent web-based tender submission and bidding portal for projects funded by the BRICS New Development Bank be established so that companies can compete for projects in a standardized and consistent manner.\n\nThe ninth BRICS summit will be held in southeast China's coastal city of Xiamen on Sept 3-5.\n"}

And this is what they’re about to be in the future,” Xiao said on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in Davos on Tuesday.\nHe said the focus would be to strictly separate government functions from the SOEs’ business operations, though it was vital for the ruling Communist Party to retain control of the state sector during the process.\nThe number of enterprises administered by the central government has been reduced to 98 from 117 in 2012.\nChina must lower GDP expectations and push SOE reform, says S&P Global Ratings economist\nThe merger of China’s top coal miner, Shenhua Group, and China Guodian Group, among the country’s top five state power producers, created the world’s largest power utility worth US$278 billion.\nWhen asked about further SOE consolidation, Xiao said the number of central government-owned companies would continue to decrease through mergers in “a voluntary process”, though Sasac did not have a target for this reduction.\nXiao also stressed the importance of the relocation of workers during the reforms, saying that SOEs, with the help from local governments, ought to create programmes to absorb retrenched workers after consultation with them.\n\n“We do not want them to be laid off or just fired in this process,” he said. “We need them to be allocated into new positions.”\nEnterprises owned by China’s central government reported robust growth last year, with total profit up 15.2 per cent, the fastest in five years.\nIn the interview, Xiao attributed the rebound of SOEs’ profitability to China’s stable economic growth, rising commodity prices and ongoing state-sector reforms.\nEx-Morgan Stanley Asia head warns against ‘Japan-like’ approach to Chinese SOE reform\n“We reduced a lot of ‘zombie enterprises’. Now the management efficiency of the companies is significantly improved,” he said.\nThe Communist Party’s People’s Daily reported this month that central government-owned SOEs had met their target of shutting 1,200 zombie enterprises by the end of last year.\nMoreover, state-owned enterprises will target coal capacity cuts of 12.65 million tonnes in 2018, and will also aim to reduce excess capacity in coal-fired power, non-ferrous metals, shipbuilding and construction materials.\nXiao said SOEs’ leverage was at “healthy levels”, and bankruptcies and liquidation had only happened at second-tier companies, not at the holding group level.\nSasac has pledged to further lower debt ratios of central government-owned firms by another 2 percentage points by the end of 2020.\nXiao expects market-driven SOE bankruptcies to continue.\n“As long as you’re market player, you have your good times and you have your bad times, and sometimes you just go bankrupt,” he said.\nAs SOEs spearhead investment in infrastructure projects overseas under “Beijing’s Belt and Road Initiative”, the strengthened leadership of the Communist Party at SOEs is raising concerns that political factors will be prioritised.\nThe value of overseas assets held by China’s centrally owned enterprises has exceeded 6 trillion yuan (US$940 billion), with investments in more than 185 countries and regions.\nWhile saying the government will slowly move to play a less direct role in the business operations of state firms, Xiao defended the party’s control of the state sector.\n‘Too big to fail’ SOEs are holding back China’s financial reform, says CLSA report\nImposing party discipline on state firms remained a key part in choosing top management and in fighting graft at SOEs, he said, adding that he did not see any conflict of interest between state political goals and commercial interests of SOEs.\n“SOEs are owned by the general public, which means everyone in this country is a shareholder. Then we need a representative, which is the Chinese Communist Party, to supervise and play a scrutiny role for the companies,” Xiao said.\nXiao said that during his meetings with CEOs in Davos, business leaders had expressed strong interest in China, in working with its SOEs and in the future of SOE reforms.\n“I can’t tell you what the SOE sector will be in 10 or 20 years, but we do hope that SOEs could be exactly like other companies: they will have higher liquidity of their assets and respond more efficiently to market changes,” Xiao said.\nYou are signed up. We think you'd also like\n"}

But it was part of a much broader trend – countries around the world have already introduced new rules, and those that haven’t are talking about it.\nThe price has mostly levelled out in recent weeks, after regulation brought volatility and a slowly sliding price. But there might be more disruption coming, as countries look towards regulation, worried about the activity and behaviour that bitcoin could be enabling.\nThat was obvious as world leaders arrived at the latest World Economic Forum in Davos and were asked their opinion. That could be a preview of far more wide-ranging controls that could be introduced in March, when the G20 governments’ financial and economic leaders meet in Argentina – a number of the countries attending have specifically said they will focus on fixing regulation of cryptocurrencies at that meeting.\nThey include France and Germany, which are said to be working together on bitcoin regulation. Many other countries have called for the international community to work together to bring regulation to bitcoin.\nDavos was a platform for various world leaders to give their opinion on bitcoin. And they all seemed to agree on one thing.\n“My number-one focus on cryptocurrencies, whether that be digital currencies or bitcoin or other things, is that we want to make sure that they’re not used for illicit activities,” said Steven Mnuchin, Donald Trump’s most senior financial policymaker.\n“We encourage fintech and we encourage innovation, but we want to make sure all of our financial markets are safe .We want to make sure that the rest of the world – and many of the (Group of) 20 countries are already starting on this – have the same regulations.”\nAnother senior US official suggested that regulation would have to come – and be international.\n“We feel very strongly that we need to have this kind of regulation all over the world,” Sigal Mandelker, the Treasury undersecretary for terrorism and financial intelligence, said. She noted that Japan and Australia are already regulating cryptocurrency trading.\n“The EU, I understand, is moving very quickly in that direction and we think it’s very important that similar regulations are happening in a number of other countries.”\nTheresa May has given a similar commitment. “Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, we should be looking at these very seriously, precisely because of the way that they can be used, particularly by criminals,” the Prime Minister told Bloomberg Television in an interview in Davos.\nIt could vary between the lightest of touches and a complete ban. Many lawmakers don’t really seem to know – lots of governments don’t seem to entirely understand cryptocurrency, let alone understand what rules they’re going to put in place.\nBut in South Korea, for instance, a variety of rules have been introduced to try and curb some of the more dangerous behaviour. Those include rules that force everyone to put their real name to their bitcoin holdings and transactions, removing the anonymity of the cryptocurrencies in an attempt to keep them more above board.\nBut initially, in that country, regulators suggested they could ban them entirely. That was probably a negotiating technique, but it was an important and potent one; other governments might learn from that and make the same threat, even if they don’t intend on carrying on with it.\nThe depth of any regulation is likely to depend on how many people are involved with cryptocurrencies, how much they’re being used for illicit behaviour, and whether they begin to pose more danger to civilians. If the price keeps going up, for instance, and people keep trying to buy them, then governments might be expected to step in and ensure that people remain safe.\nCryptocurrencies are built partly to avoid the threat of regulation. They’re decentralised, so that there’s no central power for governments to clamp down on; trades are largely anonymous, meaning that it’s difficult to find out who’s actually doing them, so it’s difficult to introduce individual restrictions too.\nBut there are lots of reasons to think people would abide by restrictions if they were put in place. Not everyone would, of course; but not everyone abides by any law.\nFor one, people do tend to avoid breaking the law. It’s possible, of course, to avoid the eyes of the law with traditional, fiat money – that’s why cash-in-hand work still happens. But most people do pay tax on what they earn, even if they could get away with not doing.\nAlso, for now bitcoin is still only largely useful when it’s converted back into cash. Some goods and services can be bought using cryptocurrency, but few, and the surging price is actually making it harder to do so.\nObviously, bitcoin’s price doesn’t behave as most people predict it to. This article is not going to suggest that regulation would push bitcoin’s price down – that would be silly – but the trend in recent months has been that all talk of regulation puts it down.\nThe price of any asset is decided by how many people want to buy it. The threat of regulation might lead fewer people to do so, potentially putting the price down, but it might also give a veneer of respectability to something that most people are still suspicious of, and help drive interest.\nAs such, regulation might be good for the price and good for the world in the long term. And it might push the price down over the short term.\nBut it might not do any of those things, either; predictions are doomed to fail when talking about cryptocurrencies.\nWe’ve teamed up with cryptocurrency trading platform eToro.

Photo: VCG\nExperts said on Sunday that the Chinese auto industry is now in a much better position to face competition deriving from lower tariffs and that the impact of lower tariffs on the Chinese auto market and foreign carmakers' localization strategy in China would be limited.\n\nThe comments came after a top Chinese economic policymaker signaled last week that China would \"gradually\" reduce tariffs on imported cars, reiterating earlier pledges made after US officials complained that the tariff levels were unfair and were contributing to the US' trade deficit with China.\n\nIn a speech at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland on Thursday, Liu He, director of the General Office of the Central Leading Group for Financial and Economic Affairs, said that China would lower tariffs on imported cars as part of its broader efforts to further open up the Chinese market to foreign goods and services.\n\n\"China will further step up efforts to [lower tariffs on imported goods]. For example [China] will gradually reduce tariffs on imported cars,\" Liu said, pointing out that China cut tariffs on 187 imported goods from 17.3 percent to 7.7 percent in 2017.\n\nLiu's comments followed an earlier commitment made by the Chinese foreign ministry in November during US President Donald Trump's state visit to Beijing.\n\nUS officials had reportedly brought the issue to their Chinese counterparts on multiple occasions prior to the visit, asking Chinese officials to provide a level playing field for US carmakers.\n\nZheng Zeguang, a vice foreign minister, said on November 9 that China would \"gradually and appropriately\" lower tariffs on imported cars. He added that China would start to ease the 50 percent limit on foreign ownership in joint ventures for electric cars and other new-energy cars in the country's free trade zones by June 2018.\n\nLiu and Zheng did not provide a timetable or other details of the tariff reduction plan. China currently levies tariffs of up to 30 percent on imported cars.\n\nHowever, the repeated pledges from top government officials indicate that China is going to follow through with the tariff reduction, said Mei Xinyu, a research fellow with the Chinese Academy of International Trade and Economic Cooperation.\n\nDomestic benefits\n\n\"I think officials are increasingly convinced that the Chinese market is in a much better situation now and that increased competition from foreign car companies will be conducive to the development of the domestic industry,\" Mei told the Global Times on Sunday.\n\nMei noted that the move is in line with China's overall opening-up process and could ease tension with the US over this issue. \"I think it's a positive step that China can take,\" he said, adding that carmakers from Europe, the US, Japan and South Korea would benefit from the move.\n\nHowever, Wang Xin, a long-time auto industry observer, said that the impact of lower tariffs might not be as great as US officials are hoping.\n\n\"Even if China does lower tariffs on imported cars, it won't mean much, because the number of imported cars accounts for only a small fraction of China's car sales,\" Wang, who also runs online industry news site Auto Prophet, told the Global Times on Sunday.\n\nIn November 2017, China produced 3.08 million cars compared to about 122,500 imported cars, according to figures from the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers.\n\nFurthermore, Wang said that foreign carmakers' localization strategy in China is based on a number of market factors and a reduction in tariffs will not change that.\n"}

But the Davos summit is seen as offering a chance for the two sides to find common ground\nComments:\n\nChina and the United States are facing a breakdown in communication as trade tensions escalate and Washington mulls taking increasingly harsh measures against Beijing, warn former US trade officials.\nThe US Trade Representative Office said late on Monday it would impose tariffs of up to 30 per cent on foreign solar panels, specifically blaming China for its “artificially low-priced” export of the technology. It also announced up to 50 per cent penalties and import quotas on foreign-made washing machines.\nChina’s Commerce Ministry hit back on Tuesday, expressing “strong discontent” over the steps and blamed the US for “abusing trade remedy measures” and “deteriorating [the] global trade situation”.\nThe World Economic Forum which started on Tuesday in Davos, however, might offer a chance for senior officials from both countries to discuss trade issues, observers said.\nLiu He, the right-hand man of Chinese President Xi Jinping, is leading a delegation to the Swiss Alps resort, while US President Donald Trump and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross are scheduled to deliver speeches at the gathering this week.\nChina’s trade surplus with US hits record high in 2017 amid rising tensions\nSpeculation that the world’s two biggest economies are headed towards a possible trade war has gathered steam since the US suspended the Comprehensive Economic Dialogue late last year and as Trump continues to lash out against what he views as China’s unfair trade practices.\n“As far as we’ve been able to tell, there has been a strong debate going on at the most senior level in Washington on how to deal with China on trade issues,” said Timothy Stratford, a former assistant US trade representative.\n“One reason that there has not been a lot of communication between the two countries on these issues is that the administration is having a debate and working out what they should do. It is hard to communicate until they resolve that very difficult question,” said Stratford, now a managing partner at the Beijing office of the Covington and Burling law firm.\nAnother clue about US intentions could come after Trump delivers his state-of-the-union speech on January 30. A US business representative, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Trump would release a report following his address on the findings of an investigation into China’s alleged intellectual property thefts, under Section 301 of the Trade Act.\nFurther separate actions, including tariffs on other Chinese exports and investment restrictions on Chinese firms seeking to access the US market, are also expected.\nUS weighing ‘many billions’ of dollars in sanctions on Chinese items via accelerated probe\n“I suspect there are going to be actions under [the] 301 investigation, which will be much more significant to China,” said Wendy Cutler, vice-president of the Asia Society Policy Institute and a former acting deputy US trade representative.\n“From what I heard so far, it is a pretty comprehensive review and investigation, and the administration may take significant actions such as investment restriction and tariffs.”\nIt is widely believed in US government and foreign company circles that the business environment in China is deteriorating and investment barriers have increased.\n“There is a consensus that what we have done today really hasn’t worked to open China’s market to US export and investment,” Cutler said. “But the next question is, so what should we do?\n“And there is a variety of opinions, but at least the administration is moving toward using trade laws to address those problems.”\nMr Trump, as you ponder a China trade war, count the US$33 billion Chinese tourists spent in America\nWhen asked whether Davos could provide a platform for taking up the issue, Cutler said delegates from both sides were likely to hold discussions.\nThe US Trade Representative Office, under the lead of Robert Lighthizer, has adopted a harsher tone towards Beijing. It has labelled as a mistake US support for China’s accession to the World Trade Organisation in 2001 and called senior-level dialogue ineffective.\nBut the two former US trade officials called for measured actions on Washington’s part to prevent tensions from escalating into a trade war.\n“One of the benefits I’ve always found on those dialogues – in addition to the actual meetings – was all the conversations on the sidelines … So I am concerned that maybe there isn’t enough dialogue and enough communications between both sides at all levels,” Cutler said.\n“The more you talk, the better things are. It doesn’t mean that you can solve some of the problems. It doesn’t mean the US administration will not take trade actions. But it is important for both sides to have informal and direct communication to express their concerns and preview what measures they may take in the near term,” she said.\nAdded Stratford: “Hopefully both sides would communicate and explain what they are doing and why they are doing it, so that each side can respond in a measured way and not take extreme actions that would make the situation worse.”\nYou are signed up.

He cited that 14,000 new companies are registered daily in China, and pointed to the World Intellectual Property Organization’s 2017 Global Innovation Index, where China ranks 22nd overall and 1st among middle-income economies.\nThis image of China as an emerging global leader in entrepreneurship stands at odds with China’s common stereotype as a land of copycats and intellectual property thieves. Infamous examples include fake Apple stores in Chinese cities like Kunming and Shenzhen, designed to imitate authorized retail locations so closely that some employees even thought they were working for Apple. In the automotive industry, the Chinese Landwind X7’s appearance is virtually indistinguishable from a Range Rover Evoque, while Chinese manufacturer Chery’s QQ was modeled so closely off of the Chevrolet Spark that their doors were even interchangeable.\nSo how can these two competing views of Chinese innovation be reconciled?\nThe answer lies in the gradual strengthening of Chinese intellectual property rights (IPR) over the past three decades.\nBefore 1985, China had no patent law at all. But since then, China has embraced the importance of intellectual property for its economic development. As Michelle Lee, the recently departed U.S. Undersecretary of Commerce for Intellectual Property, astutely noted, China “[doesn’t] want to be the low-cost manufacturer of other countries’ inventions, competing on low-wage labor. They want to be the innovative country. To do that, you need to respect IP rights. This is a matter of national self-interest for them.”\nTo encourage innovation, local Chinese authorities went so far as to provide cash subsidies of up to $4,500 to patent recipients. As a result, China became the top patent filer in the world in 2011. It then surpassed all other countries as the top patent issuer in 2015, with over 350,000 patents issued that year alone.\nIP enforcement in China has also experienced a major transformation. Chinese courts heard over 130,000 IPR cases in 2014, a 20 percent increase from the year prior. In response to this increasing volume of IP litigation, the Chinese government established three specialized IP courts in Beijing, Shanghai, and Guangzhou. Since their creation, these three courts alone have heard more than 30,000 cases.\nAs a point of comparison, the United States heard less than 12,000 patent, trademark, and copyright cases in total for all of 2016 (or less than 10 percent of China’s total IP-related litigations in 2014).\nThe development of China’s IPR judicial infrastructure shows no sign of abating. Four new IP tribunals were established earlier this year, and Chinese leaders are considering the formation of a national IPR appeals court.\nChina has also continued to update and strengthen its IP laws. Last year, it issued its fourth amendment to the Chinese Patent Law, increasing the limit for potential statutory damages five-fold and adding a range of enforcement provisions.\nThe expansion of Chinese IPR enforcement has resulted in a number of major international victories. Earlier this year, New Balance prevailed in court to shut down several Chinese “parasite brands,” which copy foreign brands but use slightly different names protected by Chinese trademarks. For example, New Balance competes in China with brands like New Boom, New Barlun, and New Bunren. In this case, New Balance received an injunction against five Chinese manufacturers, which were then fined $250,000 after violating the injunction.\nMichael Jordan, after struggling for four years in Chinese courts, won a victory last year that granted him the rights to his Chinese name, Qiaodan. The decision reversed a lower-court opinion, and stopped a Chinese sporting goods company from using the name to promote its merchandise.\nThis shows positive momentum on trademark rights in China, given the difficulties that foreign companies often had defending their product names and logos. In 2011, Chinese courts rejected Apple’s claim to own the iPad trademark in the country, forcing Apple to pay $60 million to the Chinese firm that owned it in order to proceed with the introduction of the iPad 2 in China. In 2013, Heineken failed to block what it claimed was an infringing name registered by a Chinese sewing machine company.\nBut increasingly, foreign firms are now seeing Chinese courts as fair arbiters for IPR disputes. A Santa Clara University School of Law study found that from 2006 to 2011, foreign patent owners won 70 percent of Chinese patent infringement cases brought against local firms. When the global law firm Rouse extended the time range to 2014, they found that this foreign success rate in getting Chinese courts to defend their patents against local infringement actually increased to approximately 80 percent.\nChina is also now seen as a more favorable venue for IP litigation because of the speed of its judicial process. Beijing’s IP court concluded cases within 125 days on average, compared to 18 months in Europe. In the United States, the median time-to-trial alone is 2.4 years for patent litigation, according to a study by PwC.\nWhile China has made substantial progress to protect and promote intellectual property rights, it still faces a number of challenges. Items originating from China and Hong Kong still represent over 85 percent of the value of all infringing and counterfeit items seized by U.S. Customs, with a total estimated MSRP value of over $1.2 billion.\nChina also has major issues with trade secret misappropriation, according to the U.S. Trade Representative’s 2016 report on China’s WTO compliance. “Most troubling,” it states, “are reports that actors affiliated with the Chinese government and the Chinese military have infiltrated the computer systems of U.S. companies” to steal IP data and provide commercial advantage to Chinese enterprises. In 2014, this led to the indictment of five Chinese military hackers by the US, but significant progress in stopping these actions has yet to be made.\nIn total, counterfeit goods, pirated software, and stolen trade secrets are estimated to cost the United States between $225 billion and $600 billion annually, according to a report this year from the bipartisan Commission on the Theft of American Intellectual Property, co-chaired by former Ambassador to China Jon Huntsman.\nAs with many issues in China, the status of Chinese IP rights defies one-dimensional stereotypes. While IP infringement is no longer tolerated with impunity in China, the country also still has progress to make in updating IP laws and strengthening enforcement.\nOverall, through a mix of market incentives and political pressure, China appears to be emerging as a global IP leader. And with senior Chinese leadership continuing to support IP rights at conferences like “Summer Davos,” the cultivation of entrepreneurship and intellectual property in China shows no signs of slowing.\nJason Zukus is a joint degree Master of Business Administration and Master of Public Policy candidate at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business and Harris School of Public Policy.\n"}

Alpha has established more than 20 overseas subsidiaries in North America, Europe, Southeast Asia and South Korea.\nAlpha's animations, movies and other entertainment products have been broadcast and sold in more than 100 nations and regions in five continents.\n\"Cooperation with foreign counterparts plays an important role in exploring international markets as local partners and special personnel that better understand local markets will help Alpha easily integrate with foreign markets,\" said Seven Wang, executive assistant to Alpha's president.\nAlpha has plans to establish two new offshore companies in Spain and Australia in two years, while more representative offices will also be set up in Thailand, Indonesia and Vietnam.\nAlpha is also eyeing the New Zealand market, having started efforts to expand into Canada, East Europe and South America this year.\n\"Whether a new company will be set up in New Zealand or not has yet to be decided,\" said Wang. \"Alpha has plans to build a new factory to produce toys in Indonesia next year.\"\nAs China's biggest branded toy manufacturer, Alpha sold more than 100 million items at home and abroad in 2016, netting more than 1.93 billion yuan ($291 million) from sales, up by more than 20 percent year-on-year.\nAlpha has multiple marketing channels through cooperation with retail giants such as Amazon, Walmart and Target. \"Alpha is now seeking to recruit a large number of specialists for overseas development,\" said Wang.\nListed on the Shenzhen Stock Exchange, the company established an international design and R&D center in Los Angles last year.\nThe LA center has played a big part in helping Alpha expand its world market in recent months.

{"title": "China has one big advantage in the race to build the car of the future", "author": "CNBC", "pub_time": "2017年12月7日", "url": "https://www.cnbc.com/2017/12/08/china-edge-in-the-ev-and-self-driving-car-markets.html", "content": "hina could take the lead in the self-driving car market because of its ability to make regulatory decisions relatively quickly, according to an investment advisory firm.\nDriver-less technology is one of several sources of disruption that traditional automakers are facing today. While many U.S. start-ups and large companies have been extensively working on this new technology, there's another important factor to consider in the nascent market, Michael Dunne, president at Dunne Automotive, told CNBC.\n\"There's more to it than just technology. Regulation matters a lot,\" Dunne said at the sidelines of Fortune Global Forum in Guangzhou, China.\nGiven how new driver-less technology is, regulators will have to do a lot of work to firm up laws that will govern autonomous driving in the future.\nThat, according to Dunne, is where China and Chinese companies have an edge because of how the decision-making process works in Beijing. He said that the \"Chinese government can, and will, facilitate autonomous driving sooner than we will in the United States, for example. China could take the lead very easily because of this.\"\n\"It's not without precedent here in China that they make a decision and tomorrow morning at 6 a.m., the expressway from Guangzhou to Shenzhen is now autonomous-only. Any objections? Okay great, here we go,\" he explained as an example of how quickly decision-making could work in the country, which is governed by a single political party.\nAt the same time, Chinese companies are also catching up with their Silicon Valley counterparts when it comes to developing more sophisticated driver-less technology. That is being done through major Chinese investments into California to conduct research and development around autonomous technology, Dunne said.\nFor example, earlier this year, Uber rival Didi Chuxing set up a research and development center in Mountain View, California. A team of scientists, engineers and researchers will look into the use of artificial intelligence in security and intelligent driving technologies, the company said.\n\"I'm talking about billions of dollars, thousands of employees — getting first-class talent from Apple, Google, and Tesla to say 'Hey we'll do our R&D in California, design in California, we'll commercialize back in China.' That's the formula to look for,\" he added.\nAnother source of disruption to traditional automakers is the growing popularity of electric or hybrid vehicles. In China, Dunne said, the demand for electric vehicles will first come from the commercial sector, then from individual drivers.\n\"We will see demand, especially in taxi fleets. There's tens of thousands of taxis running in cities in China,\" he said. \"Those will go electric first. Buses and delivery vans, watch the commercial space ... there will be demand from enterprises first, individuals later.\"\nIn September, China set a 2019 deadline for automakers to meet green-car sales targets, according to Reuters. Car makers will have to amass credits for so-called new-energy vehicles that will need to be equivalent to 10 percent of annual sales by 2019, China's industry ministry said, Reuters reported.\n\"The thinking from the Chinese government is you won't make money on electrics for the first five years but you'll subsidize electric demand through your sales of conventional gasoline engine cars,\" Dunne said. \"The automakers, themselves, will subsidize this movement.\"\nChina wants to set goals for electric and plug-in hybrid cars to make up at least a fifth of domestic auto sales by 2025, Reuters reported.\nDunne said both local and foreign automakers — some of which have formed new joint ventures in the space — will likely see profitability in the electric vehicle market around 2021 and 2022. That is because automakers are still waiting for the cost of batteries to go down.\n\"Until then, it'll be a war of attrition. Who's the last man standing? That's what it's going to be about,\" Dunne said.\nChinese firms, however, have rapidly been making deals to secure supplies of lithium, which is a vital component used in batteries for electric vehicles.\nAccording to Dunne, the demand for electric vehicles in China will start \"on the very low end,\" and he predicted that companies inside the country might even produce electric vehicles costing less than $15,000.\nAt the same time, there could also be some demand from the \"very high end\" owing to the fact that China \"happens to have the largest luxury car market in the world,\" Dunne explained.\n\nPlaying\nShare this video...\nWatch Next...\n"}

(Chinese source)\n“We now see many people in the street using Ofo, and we are confident that we can make money,” Dai Wei says. The main source of revenue is the user’s riding costs and other profit models are icing on the cake. He predicts that Ofo will reach breakeven this year and will be profitable in 2018.\nJust the day before the summer Davos Forum, photo of  Dai Wei and Mobike’s co-founder and president Hu Weiwei spread out in the social platforms quickly, causing rumors that “the two sides are about to merge.”\n“I think there is no basis for the merger, do not need to merge, the industry is not about dominating a market, rather co-exist in the market together.” Dai Wei says. He believes that for the new businesses, it will be a better strategy for them to focus on localizing their operations.\nWhen Ofo announced that all the Ofo bikes will change to smart locks, they also said that the new registered user deposit will be increased from the previous 99 RMB to 199 RMB.\nThrough Sesame credit (芝麻信用), a social credit scoring system developed by Ant Financial, Ofo provided deposit service for some cities, such as Shanghai, Guangzhou and Hangzhou. By upgrading to the smart lock and the increasing the deposit at the same time, Ofo made sure that they build trust and give an image that they are financially healthy.\n“In the business model of Ofo, the deposit didn’t have any meaning. In the long-term, the deposit will be entirely free.” Dai Wei said. Raising the deposit is mainly to deal with the bad credit users, to prevent and reduce their damage to the Ofo bikes.\nDai Wei said that the deposit of a 199 RMB for a user can later be transferred into 99 RMB if the user’s long-term credit is high. If their credit is good enough, they can even cancel the deposit through the Sesame credit.\n“Ofo want different credit-level users to correspond to different deposits to build a more scientific and intelligent credit system.” Dai Wei says. “In the future, for those who had a low credit rating, Ofo will plan for a 299 RMB deposit.”\nOfo was born on campus, and a year later Ofo began to expand into the cities like Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou and other first-tier cities. Ofo now covers 150 cities in China, and Dai Wei said that Ofo will basically cover all the third tier cities from the end of 2017 to the beginning of 2018; then Ofo will cover the city above the county level by June 2018, .\n“There are 4-5 times space we can grow in the next 12 months. First-tier cities tend to saturate, and are only a few numbers of cities.” While the third or fourth-tier city based has bigger number of cities, the future of this market is see explosive growth, Da Wei says.\nAt present, Ofo operates in four countries: United States, the United Kingdom, Singapore and Kazakhstan and has offices in more than 20 countries, with more than 50 full-time employees, responsible for local team formation, management and maintenance of local supply chains.\nThe reason why overseas markets are relatively difficult to expand is because the sharing of bicycles need to go through the local government’s permit, and the bicycle product specifications are not exactly the same for each country. For example, in the UK, safety lights need to be installed to bicycles.\nOfo will focus on its entry to Western Europe and Southeast Asia in the second half of 2017. At present, Ofo is in communication with many countries to carry out business permits, including: Major European countries like Germany, France, the Netherlands and Spain, Southeast Asian countries like Malaysia, Indonesia, Thailand and Myanmar.\nEva Yoo is Shanghai-based tech writer.

Hundreds of millions of people are taking planes, trains, cars, buses, ferries and motorbikes back to their families for the Spring Festival which falls on Friday. Altogether, about 3 billion trips are expected to be made between February 1 and March 12 during the rush known as Chunyun, a similar figure to last year.\nEvery year – and this year is no exception – there are the all too familiar, heart-rending scenes of tens of millions of migrant labourers on the move. They may have toiled and built the country’s high-speed railways and gleaming airports, but they usually choose the less modern and cheaper ways home to save money.\nHundreds of thousands will ride motorbikes for days and nights on journeys of up to 1,400km, dressed in raincoats to brave the rain, sleet and snow, with their loved ones and goods strapped on their back seats.\n\nOthers, with huge nylon bags on their shoulders or their backs and their children in tow, will jam railway stations as they wait for the slower and cheaper overnight trains. Many of them will have to stand for 10 hours or more on the crowded, oversold train journeys.\nBut they are still the lucky ones, considering that at least they bring their hard-earned salaries with them. Tens of thousands of other workers across the country will be stranded in the cities where they work as they have not been paid at all, not knowing what to expect and facing a hard decision on whether they should go home empty-handed after a year of hard work and inhospitable living in crowded dorms.\nThe acute problem of wage arrears has been an issue for migrant labourers for decades.\nIt is another all too familiar scene. Every year, in the run-up to the Spring Festival, Chinese state media are full of reports on how the central government and local authorities help migrant labourers to get their money back. The officials are quoted making empty promises that they will not allow the problem to happen again, until the following year.\nHundreds of millions of migrant labourers have helped build China’s economy into the world’s second largest through hard work and low pay.\nBut they are at the very low end of Chinese society as the hukou, or household registration, system and other government regulations restrict their access to health services, education and other social benefits of the city they work in – for both themselves and their children.\nThe recent campaign by Beijing and other bigger cities to evict hundreds of thousands of migrant workers from “illegal structures” in the middle of a cold winter in the name of safety is the latest aggravation of their plight. The campaign to force out the so-called “low-end” population was halted following strong condemnation but not before many had already been thrown out.\n\nBut the worst form of exploitation is still employers’ blatant refusal to pay migrant workers on time. The problem has existed from the early years of China’s reforms and opening up as farmers were drawn to the cities for work. Lack of proper contracts and effective government regulations have led to a widespread practice in which workers are mostly given one-off payments before the Lunar New Year. This has created opportunities for many unscrupulous businessmen and contractors to deduct salary payments or even withhold payments, particularly if their cash flows are strapped.\nAs the problem has grown, authorities have introduced monthly salary systems and ordered firms to set aside funds on a monthly basis to guarantee payments. But in the massive construction sector, which employs the biggest number of migrant workers, they are still given one-off payments – partly because owners and investors tend to settle their accounts in full only after a construction project has been completed.\n\nIt is in this sector where corruption in the form of illicit subcontracting is rampant and wage arrears are the worst. Despite frequent government crackdowns, it is common for construction projects to be sub-contracted through several layers. On each layer, corrupt and well-connected middlemen charge a hefty commission before subcontracting the project on to the next layer.\nThis has created loopholes in which workers are often refused payments as investors, contractors, and sub-contractors blame each other for withholding funds. It is not uncommon for workers to be left in the lurch and not paid for years because some middlemen subcontractors have fled with funds or are in financial difficulties.\nTo be fair, the central government has stepped up efforts to crack down on businesses and contractors who decline to pay workers on time. In the first 11 months of 2017, the authorities investigated 128,000 cases and helped 2.81 million workers recover their payments with a total amount of 22.45 billion yuan (US$3.6 billion), Xinhua reported.\n\nStarting from 2004, the central government has required developers and investors to deposit a certain percentage of their total amount of investment into protected accounts controlled by the local authorities to ensure payments if disputes arise. But the rule is frequently flouted at local levels.\nAccording to a recent investigative report by China Central Television, many construction workers in Heilongjiang had still not been paid just days away from the holiday, hinting at collusion between developers and officials who allowed the projects to start even though the developers had not paid in the salary guarantee funds. It said similar incidents had occurred in other parts of the country. The footage, showing several dozen workers huddling outside the developers’ offices in temperatures of minus 30 degrees Celsius, is a stain on the collective conscience of the country and a damning indictment of its dismal failure over a period of decades to allow such blatant exploitation to continue. ■\nWang Xiangwei is the former editor-in-chief of the South China Morning Post.

Alibaba is very excited to work together with XPENG Motors to accelerate the integration and innovation across sectors, leading to more-rapid development in smart transportation.”\nAll told, with its full Series A round and this Series B round, XPENG said it will have raised over RMB5 billion via capital markets. Co-investors in the Series B round are Yunfeng Capital and China International Capital Corp. Ltd. Other series A+ investors again backing the Series B round are GGV Capital, Morningside Venture Capital and Matrix Partners. Individual investors include Yuri Milner, known for his backing of science and technology startups.\n“Alibaba is the world’s leading science and technology company, Foxconn is the world’s benchmark company for high-tech manufacturing, and IDG Capital is the world’s top investment entity. It is, thus, an important milestone for XPENG Motors that Alibaba, Foxconn and IDG Capital are the joint lead investors in this round of fundraising,” said XPENG Motors Chairman He Xiaopeng.\nXPENG earlier this month unveiled its G3 model at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, saying it would be available to the public this spring, with configurations and price made available at that time. It’s positioning the G3 SUV as the vehicle of choice for those with a “geek lifestyle.”\nThe G3 features an array of sensors – cameras and radar – making it one of the smartest self-driving vehicles among Chinese brands. XPENG was the first company to receive China Compulsory Certification from the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology in July 2017. It released its first production car in October 2017. And on Dec. 3, Chairman He Xiaopeng drove the first plated Xpeng car on public roads in Beijing.\nHe has previous ties to Alibaba. He co-founded Chinese mobile web browser company UCWeb and was president of Alibaba’s mobile business group.

In comparison, the northeastern region saw a diminishing economic role.\nCity clusters in 10 regions including the Pearl River Delta, Yangtze River Delta and Bohai Sea Rim have formed China's dominant economic circles. Average economic growth in most city clusters is above the national level, suggesting that they are the main driving force of growth, according to the report.\nDespite the economic slowdown in recent years, there's no evidence that China's urbanization has lost momentum. The population is increasingly migrating to cities in central China and those at a higher level in the country's administrative hierarchy.\nNi Pengfei, director of the academy, led researchers to finish the report after six months.

It is a strategic \"bridge\" that connects the west and east bank of the Pearl River estuaries.\nThis district is bordered on the north by Nansha District in Guangzhou, the capital of Guangdong province, and on the south by Hengqin Free Trade Zone in Zhuhai, east of Qianhai Area in Shenzhen.\nThe delegation visited some of the strategic development projects already completed in the District, including the Sino-Swiss Industrial Park.\nThe park is located in the core region of Tsuiheng New District, covering an area of 7 square kilometers, and positioned to become a Sino-European-American synergetic development platform that is innovation-driven and technology-oriented with high-end industries, cultural integration and ecological demonstrations. By now, the park hosts 24 foreign projects, including from Germany's Fassmer-Marland, Switzerland's SSM and the United States' Poolpak.\nBy hosting this event, the Zhongshan government aims to attract more foreign investment to the district.

He's had the job since 2002, making him China's and the G-20's longest-serving central bank head, working under three Chinese presidents and alongside three U.S. Federal Reserve governors.\nOne of his greatest accomplishments was to end a direct peg of China's yuan to the dollar, allowing market forces to play a greater role in setting the value of the currency.\nUnder his tenure, Zhou, 69, also oversaw the rise of the yuan to become more internationally accepted as a reserve currency. Zhou was at times controversial given his support for financial reform, making him a radical thinker in Beijing circles.\nZhou, an engineer by training and fluent in English, was well-liked abroad. He \"had an international profile ... in terms of reassuring the international markets — everyone thought he had a great deal of credibility and listened to him,\" said Kerry Brown, professor of Chinese politics at King's College London. \"That's a hard act to follow.\"\nLately, Beijing has tightened its grip on the yuan to fend off market volatility and financial risk. While wider calls for market-oriented reform haven't gone away, experts say China is questioning what will work best at home.\nThere's a \"diminishing confidence in the Western model, post-global financial crisis,\" said Andrew Polk, co-founder and economist at Beijing-based research firm Trivium China.\nUnlike its Western counterparts, China's central bank doesn't have full autonomy to decide policy: The State Council, the country's highest executive body, has the final say. Still, the PBOC did gain some relative independence under Zhou. What's at stake now is how much liberty Beijing's pick for the job will have — or if China's top leaders will exert greater control on the levers behind the scenes.\nMeet the two frontrunners:\n\nGuo currently heads the China Banking Regulatory Commission. He previously led the securities regulatory body, served as the chairman of state-owned China Construction Bank, and was head of the State Administration of Foreign Exchange. He also held political positions, including as governor of Shandong province and vice governor of Guizhou province. He was born in Inner Mongolia, has a bachelor's in philosophy and a PhD in law, and has long been floated for the job.\nSince taking up his CBRC post in February, Guo has overseen a number of actions cracking down on risks in China's financial system.\n\"These new measures indicate that Guo intends to pursue more regulatory enforcement and advance the role of his commission more forcefully than did his predecessor,\" analysts at risk consultancy Eurasia Group wrote in an April note. That expectation has held true.\nGuo is known for being brash, and he ruffled feathers at the helm of the China Securities Regulatory Commission. But his recent moves at the CBRC appear to have support among top leaders.\nJiang was named Communist Party Secretary of Hubei province last October, and has served as the chairman of two state-owned banks – Bank of Communications and Agricultural Bank of China – and as head of China Development Bank, a government financial institution.\nEarlier in his career, he also led the PBOC's Shenzhen and Guangzhou branches. In Guangzhou, he dealt with what was then China's biggest bankruptcy ever: a $5 billion default of Guangdong International Trust and Investment Corporation that made headlines in 1999. It was the first since the Communist revolution in 1949, and Jiang worked to stem the fallout with Wang Qishan, who was then the vice governor of the province and is now China's powerful anti-corruption czar.\n\"In China, this type of early firefighting with a political rising star is where careers are often made, and Wang Qishan is still seen to be a Jiang backer,\" said Polk.\nA few other names are on the short list: Liu Shiyu, chairman of the China Securities Regulatory Commission, and Yi Gang, the PBOC's deputy governor. But experts say it's looking more like a two-horse race between Guo and Jiang.\n\nThe government has engineered calm and stability in China's economy and markets leading up to a major leadership shuffle, due to take place next month. As such, Beijing has been mum on major reform plans all year.\nPresident Xi Jinping is sailing into his second term in power, and \"the presumption here is that what happened in the first five years was all politics,\" said Damien Ma, a fellow at think tank Paulson Institute.\nHe said he expects to see \"more doubling down on reforms, and if the reforms go down to deleveraging, fixing the state sector in a more meaningful way, you're not going to get amazing growth out of that.\"\nWhen it comes to pushing ideas through, Jiang would \"be less independent — he's a [Communist] Party man through and through — and someone like Guo Shuqing seems a little bit more willing to carve out a space to operate,\" Polk said.\nBecause of Jiang's political clout, \"he could have a really strong voice, but there's a chance he just falls in line and diminishes the PBOC's relative autonomy,\" he added.\nGuo, on the other hand, speaks English, and is more well-known internationally, and that's important if China is seeking a greater role on the world stage. If Guo gets the job, it would likely be \"viewed as a market positive — Guo is more of a known quantity, as he's been in the finance world a while,\" said Ma.\nThe perfect candidate will need to have access and credibility with Xi, Brown said, adding that the new governor will also need to be able to \"meet finance ministers, bankers from elsewhere, like the Bank of England and the Federal Reserve, and be able to talk the same language.\"\nExperts are divided on whether it even matters who gets the job: Against constantly shifting political winds and a lack of transparency in government, it's hard to really tell how much power the governor can wield when it comes to setting policy.\nAnd it's policy that generally drives how investors view Chinese markets, said an employee at one of China's state-owned securities firms, who requested anonymity given the sensitive nature of the topic.\n\"China is still a top-down place,\" he said. \"The guy who ends up in that seat will be someone who [Xi] pretty much trusts, and someone pretty loyal to him.\"\n"}

Ce n'est qu'en oeuvrant ensemble pour construire une communautÃ© de destin pour l'humanitÃ© que la vie des populations Ã  travers le monde pourra Ãªtre amÃ©liorÃ©e, a fait remarquer M. Xi. Un point de vue qui rÃ©sonne toujours Ã  Davos, alors que le monde est confrontÃ© plus que jamais Ã  un sentiment d'anti-mondialisation et Ã  un protectionnisme croissants.\nUNE CAUSE COMMUNE\n\"Aujourd'hui, l'humanitÃ© est devenue une communautÃ© soudÃ©e de destin [...]. Nous devons nous engager Ã  dÃ©velopper une Ã©conomie mondiale ouverte pour partager les opportunitÃ©s et les intÃ©rÃªts Ã  travers l'ouverture et atteindre des rÃ©sultats gagnant-gagnant\", a dÃ©clarÃ© M. Xi dans son discours lors de la rÃ©union annuelle de Davos le 17 janvier 2017.\nAlors que les fissures gÃ©ostratÃ©giques ont refait surface sur de multiples fronts avec des consÃ©quences Ã©tendues sur les plans politique, Ã©conomique et social, l'interprÃ©tation par la Chine du dÃ©veloppement commun y apporte des solutions, en mettant l'accent sur l'Ã©galitÃ©, l'Ã©quitÃ© et l'inclusion.\nLe discours du prÃ©sident Xi Jinping revÃªt une signification historique, et son engagement en faveur d'un esprit d'ouverture et de collaboration a impressionnÃ© les participants, a dÃ©clarÃ© Klaus Schwab, fondateur et prÃ©sident du FEM, dans une interview accordÃ©e rÃ©cemment Ã  Xinhua.\nM. Schwab a saluÃ© l'influence de la Chine sur la lutte contre le changement climatique, l'avenir d'Internet et le financement du dÃ©veloppement Ã  travers le projet \"La Ceinture et la Route\". En outre, les entreprises chinoises se sont elles aussi responsabilisÃ©es sur la scÃ¨ne internationale, notamment dans les domaines du commerce et de l'Ã©conomie circulaire.\nLe prÃ©sident chinois a lancÃ© cette idÃ©e de construire une communautÃ© de destin mondiale en mars 2013 lors d'une visite Ã  Moscou. Au cours des annÃ©es suivantes, M. Xi a affinÃ© sa vision de la gouvernance mondiale. L'Ã©laboration de ce concept Ã  Davos l'an dernier lui a valu de nombreux Ã©loges tant en Chine qu'Ã  l'Ã©tranger.\nDans son rapport au 19e CongrÃ¨s national du Parti communiste chinois en octobre dernier, M. Xi a soulevÃ© Ã  plusieurs reprises l'idÃ©e de construire une communautÃ© de destin pour l'humanitÃ©, traÃ§ant une feuille de route pour la politique Ã©trangÃ¨re de la Chine qui lie le futur du pays Ã  celui du monde entier.\n\"La Chine continuera Ã  jouer son rÃ´le en tant que grande puissance responsable, participera activement Ã  la rÃ©forme et au dÃ©veloppement du systÃ¨me de gouvernance mondiale et n'aura de cesse d'y apporter sa sagesse et sa force\", a indiquÃ© M. Xi dans son rapport.\nUNE VISION EN ACTION\nDans son discours prononcÃ© l'an dernier Ã  Davos, M. Xi a prÃ©sentÃ© un plan pour le dÃ©veloppement commun, allant des relations internationales, de la sÃ©curitÃ© et de la stabilitÃ© aux Ã©changes culturels et Ã  la protection de l'environnement, afin d'avancer avec le monde dans la construction d'une communautÃ© de destin.\nDepuis, la Chine a pris des mesures concrÃ¨tes Ã  cet Ã©gard. En mai dernier, Beijing a reÃ§u des dizaines de dirigeants mondiaux au premier Forum de \"la Ceinture et la Route\" pour la coopÃ©ration internationale.\nProposÃ©e par M. Xi en 2013, l'initiative \"La Ceinture et la Route\" vise Ã  raccorder les politiques, les infrastructures, le commerce, la finance et les Ã©changes entre les peuples le long et au-delÃ  des anciennes routes de la Soie, de sorte Ã  construire une nouvelle plateforme de coopÃ©ration internationale qui permettra d'insuffler un nouvel Ã©lan Ã  la croissance.\nJusqu'Ã  prÃ©sent, une centaine de pays et d'organisations internationales ont rÃ©pondu positivement Ã  l'initiative et promis d'y apporter leur soutien. Plus de 80 pays et organisations internationales ont signÃ© des accords de coopÃ©ration avec la Chine.\nEn s'appuyant sur l'idÃ©e de construire une communautÃ© de destin pour l'humanitÃ©, la Chine a activement dÃ©veloppÃ© des partenariats mondiaux et Ã©largi la convergence de ses intÃ©rÃªts avec d'autres pays.\nLa Chine fait ainsi avancer la coopÃ©ration et la coordination avec les grands pays tout en renforÃ§ant les relations avec les pays en dÃ©veloppement en respectant les principes d'amitiÃ©, de sincÃ©ritÃ©, de rÃ©ciprocitÃ© des bÃ©nÃ©fices et de prise en compte des intÃ©rÃªts de tous.\nDans le cadre de l'initiative \"La Ceinture et la Route\", la Chine a aidÃ© d'autres pays dans le domaine des infrastructures dans le monde entier.\nEn mai dernier, le prÃ©sident kenyan Uhuru Kenyatta a inaugurÃ© la nouvelle ligne de chemin de fer Ã  Ã©cartement normal Mombasa-Nairobi, d'une longueur de 480 km, construite par des entreprises chinoises, signe du soutien de la Chine Ã  l'industrialisation, la prospÃ©ritÃ© et l'intÃ©gration rÃ©gionale de l'Afrique.\nEn outre, la Chine est un ferme partisan de la lutte contre le rÃ©chauffement climatique. L'Agence internationale de l'Ã©nergie a indiquÃ© l'an dernier dans un rapport que la Chine, premier investisseur en Ã©nergie du monde, a vu une chute de 25% de ses investissements dans les centrales Ã  charbon en 2016, utilise de plus en plus des sources d'Ã©lectricitÃ© propres et investit dans l'efficacitÃ© Ã©nergÃ©tique. Elle estime que la Chine dÃ©passera l'Europe d'ici quelques annÃ©es sur le plan des investissements dans l'efficacitÃ© Ã©nergÃ©tique.\nDans son discours du Nouvel An de 2018, le prÃ©sident Xi a dÃ©clarÃ© : \"La Chine remplira activement ses obligations et devoirs internationaux, restera fidÃ¨le Ã  ses engagements en matiÃ¨re de lutte contre le changement climatique, promouvra activement l'initiative 'La Ceinture et la Route' et sera toujours un artisan de la paix dans le monde, un contributeur au dÃ©veloppement mondial et un gardien de l'ordre international\".\nUN CONSENSUS EN EXPANSION\nLe professeur Angus Deaton, laurÃ©at du prix Nobel d'Ã©conomie de 2015, a indiquÃ© qu'il apprÃ©ciait les efforts dÃ©ployÃ©s par la Chine pour bÃ¢tir une communautÃ© de destin et les contributions apportÃ©es par la Chine au monde et Ã  la mondialisation.\nDans son discours, M. Xi a annoncÃ© au monde que la Chine favorisait la mondialisation et appelait les autres pays Ã  conjuguer leurs efforts Ã  cette fin, a rappelÃ© M. Deaton.\nReconnaissant les contributions et les efforts de la Chine, le Conseil de sÃ©curitÃ© de l'ONU a adoptÃ©, pour la premiÃ¨re fois dans une rÃ©solution en mars dernier, le concept de \"communautÃ© de destin\" avancÃ© par Xi Jinping.\nCe concept reflÃ¨te la vision large et humaine du prÃ©sident chinois pour une meilleure gouvernance mondiale, et intervient alors que les puissances mondiales cherchaient l'inspiration pour relever les dÃ©fis et les risques auxquels se heurte le monde actuel.\nDans un entretien accordÃ© Ã  Xinhua, Michael Moller, directeur gÃ©nÃ©ral de l'Office des Nations unies Ã  GenÃ¨ve, a indiquÃ© que ce concept du prÃ©sident Xi Ã©tait trÃ¨s impressionnant et \"extrÃªmement bienvenu\", particuliÃ¨rement dans le monde d'aujourd'hui confrontÃ© Ã  des fragmentations, des confrontations et des difficultÃ©s.\n\"Ce concept rÃ©pond dans une large mesure Ã  ce dont le monde a besoin aujourd'hui. Il est trÃ¨s important pour la communautÃ© internationale d'avoir ce genre d'approche beaucoup plus collaborative pour aider Ã  rÃ©soudre les problÃ¨mes actuels, mais aussi les problÃ¨mes futurs\", a dÃ©clarÃ© M. Moller. \"Nous avons besoin de chefs de file, nous avons besoin de grands pays comme la Chine pour nous aider Ã  rÃ©aliser nos objectifs communs.\"\nDe l'autre cÃ´tÃ© de l'ocÃ©an Atlantique, les hauts responsables mondiaux, comme les participants au forum de Davos, partagent la vision de Xi Jinping.\nAlicia Barcena, secrÃ©taire exÃ©cutive de la Commission Ã©conomique de l'ONU pour l'AmÃ©rique latine et les CaraÃ¯bes, a indiquÃ© mardi que les pays de la rÃ©gion oeuvraient Ã  la concrÃ©tisation d'une communautÃ© de destin pour l'humanitÃ©, avec pour objectif de crÃ©er un monde plus pacifique et plus durable.\n\"La Chine joue un rÃ´le important dans les efforts visant Ã  rÃ©aliser une prospÃ©ritÃ© commune et une paix durable Ã  travers le monde\", a-t-elle estimÃ© lors de la seconde rÃ©union ministÃ©rielle du Forum Chine-CELAC (CommunautÃ© des Etats d'AmÃ©rique latine et des CaraÃ¯bes).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

The average price was around 55,000 yuan ($8,267) per square meter, about 10 percent lower than in the second quarter this year, according to property information provider anjuke.com.\nHainan province also launched a new policy to suspend the development of small apartments below 100 square meters in specific coastal regions, generally purchased as second homes or holiday homes.\nInvestors who bought properties in coastal cities in Hainan province may only live in property for a couple of months, and leave the property empty for the rest of the year, which may put great pressure on public resources, and cause a great waste of land resources.\nSqueezing this unreasonable demand out of the market will spare resources for local residents, creating a more rational property market, said local housing authorities.\nMore cities further tightened conditions for transactions in the housing market before Oct 1 to prevent a sudden overheating in the peak season.\nNew rules in Chongqing and Nanchang said that in central districts, buyers of newly built properties will not be allowed to sell the properties for at least two years. In Guiyang, the limit is three years.\n\"More cities are taking steps to curb speculative demand in the housing market, an initial step toward a long-term solution allowing for the sustainable and steady development of the housing market,\" said Deng Yusong, a researcher at the Development Research Center of the State Council.\nOuyang Shijia contributed to this story.\n"}

Same is the case when compared with other multinational agencies present in China, he said.\nEven people who do not directly work in digital have to be digitally minded, because the information generated and used to make the right decisions comes from digital sources, said Domlija, who has over 20 years experience in media and marketing in the UK and China.\nThe new company will have a huge analytics team that processes and reports on data, he said.\nDomlija said he believed the new company's growth will be driven mostly by local businesses, and the company will continue injecting investment into understanding China's micro and macro-economic trends within the marketplace.\n\"Some 85 percent of our business in China is generated locally, and the percentage is much higher than our peers for international agencies,\" he said.\n\"There will be more localized decision-making and more local customers.\"\nMEC and Maxus have been focused on driving Chinese brands in the past few years, including Huawei, China Mobile, Bank of Communications, Shanghai Automotive, UnionPay and Meituan.\n\"The resource and capability we build, focusing on local business will be the cornerstone of how we will continue to grow and how we plan to develop our business,\" he said.\nAccording to Domlija, China's Belt and Road Initiative will create huge growth opportunities for Wavemaker as well as other companies.\nWestern companies are angling actively for a piece of the trade initiative, with multinationals like technology and manufacturing company Honeywell and General Electric tweaking their businesses to win more orders.\nZhang Jianping, director of international economic cooperation at the National Development and Reform Commission, said the initiative enables domestic and multinational firms to jointly explore overseas markets.\nMany Western firms are interested in being a part of China's Belt and Road Initiative, offering either technological edge or knowledge of local conditions, he said.\n\"The initiative offers huge opportunities to companies that can understand how Chinese brands work,\" said Domlija.\nZou Shuo contributed to the story.\n"}

That's closely followed by Guangzhou at 13.1 percent.\n\"The strong Chinese domestic market is behind the growth of cities such as Chongqing and Guangzhou which rely on spend from Chinese nationals for 94.5 percent and 89.1 percent of their Travel & Tourism GDP respectively,\" the report said.\nShanghai also shows growth at 12.8 percent, while China's capital city of Beijing is at 12 percent per year.\n\"The two-digit growth that we see here in this part of the world is very impressive,\" Gloria Guevara, president and CEO of the World Travel and Tourism Council told CNBC's \"The Rundown.\"\n\"China is good not only as a sourcing market for some other countries, but also their domestic traveling is huge,\" she added.\nThe other cities on the top ten list are Chengdu in China (11.2 percent), Manila in the Philippines (10.9 percent), Delhi in India (10.8 percent), Shenzhen in China (10.7 percent), Kuala Lumpur in Malaysia (10.1 percent) and Jakarta in Indonesia (10 percent).\nThe study covers a total of 65 cities, chosen for being among the top ranked for arrivals, and spending by visitors.

Automakers that do fall short will be required to buy credits.\nVolkswagen currently has around 10 NEVs already on the market in China, although all are imported models with limited sales volumes, according to a company spokeswoman.\nHeizmann, speaking ahead of the Guangzhou auto show, added that the group is aiming to sell 400,000 new energy vehicles per year in China by 2020 and 1.5 million per year by 2025. NEVs refer to all-electric battery cars and heavily electrified plug-in hybrids.\nHeizmann said some of those models will have a 400-600 kilometer driving range on a single full charge. By comparison, Tesla's model S has a range of 490 kilometer and as much as 632km depending on battery capacity, according to the company.\nThe Volkswagen Group is also confident that its group companies and their local China joint venture partners will be able to generate enough NEV sales volume to account for NEV quotas by 2019, Heizmann said, adding that there will be no need to buy credits.\n\"We need high volumes of new energy vehicles... we are working on full speed on that.\"\nLast week, General Motors Co's China chief Matt Tsien told reporters GM's China joint ventures will be able to generate enough NEV sales volume to account for NEV quotas by 2019 and without the need to buy credits.\nTsien said both GM and its China joint-venture partners \"are working to at least meet, if not exceed, those credit mandate requirements.\" The Guangzhou auto show starts on Friday.\n\nPlaying\nShare this video...\nWatch Next...\n"}

[Photo by Deng Yinming/For China Daily]\nA new high-tech solution has turned an old style Arcade toy claw machine into a trendy investment opportunity.\nBy simply using their smartphones to scan a QR code on the windows of these gaming terminals, customers can pay to play through WeChat or Alipay.\nIn a flash, the days of inserting coins have been consigned to history.\nThe sector is so hot that Leyaoyao Information Technology Ltd Co, which makes mobile payment devices for claw machines in Shenzhen, has received three rounds of funding, totaling about 60 million yuan ($8.87 million).\n\"We sold about 80,000 QR code devices for toy claw machines in more than 300 cities by May,\" the company told Sohu.com, one of China's biggest media online outlets. \"Monthly payments from these machines totaled 80 million yuan.\"\nLeyaoyao also makes money by selling advertising on its WeChat account, which users are guided to before paying to play on claw machines.\nThese are Arcade games where you try to pick up gifts, such as cuddly toys and key rings, by moving a mechanical claw.\nBefore QR coding, you could only find them in Arcades as you had to employ staff to empty the coins from the machines. But now they are sprouting up in shopping malls, movie theaters and even metro stations because you need a minimal number of staff to service them.\n\"All of our company's 4,000 machines have been equipped with mobile payment devices,\" said Li Rongwang, operations and technology director at Guangzhou Star Nigel Trade Co Ltd.\nHe also pointed out that new technology has solved the problem of \"fake coins\" for one of the largest manufacturers and operators of doll claw machines in China.\n\"The price of one fake coin is about 0.35 yuan to 0.5 yuan, but the value of our coin is 1 yuan.\"\nBy switching over to QR coding, the company's profits have increased by between 2 percent to 3 percent. \"Overall, the significance of the upgrade is about management,\" he said.\nAllpayCloud Technology Co Ltd, a startup which is also based in Guangzhou, has also transformed the toy claw machine sector after rolling out its Saas (Software as a Service) platform.\nThis is a long-distance and real-time management system, which incorporates venue placements, machines and staff.

I cannot think of any place I cannot pay with my smart phone,\" she said.\nZhang Shucui, 67, always used to take a large amount of change when going to the wet market near her home in Beijing's Haidian district, but that time has gone.\n\"The QR code replaced the change basket in front of the stalls,\" she said. \"Gone are the days when I had to search all my pockets for a coin.\"\nMonday's report also showed more than 70 percent of the 6,500-plus respondents saying they could live more than a week with only 100 yuan ($15) in cash, and 52 percent only use cash for 20 percent of their total monthly consumption.\nMei Houdui, an electronic products dealer in Shenzhen, shared a recent \"awkward\" experience - he wanted to borrow some cash as pocket money for his child at a party, and failed as no one had any cash in their pockets.\nAÂ big cakeÂ\nThe new payment pattern has won over Chinese consumers with its convenience and flexibility, squeezing the market share of card and cash payments.\n\"Alipay or WeChat?\" This is the most often question posed up when a purchase is made in China. Cards and cash, the once dominant purchasing methods, have become a second option in less than half a decade.\n\"Mobile payment companies were worried about their future just four years ago, but the spread of technology has exceeded the imagination of almost everyone,\" said Li Gang, a professor at the Tencent Research Institute.\nData from the People's Bank of China showed a total of 157 trillion yuan of payments were made on mobile devices in China last year, more than 200 times that in the United States in the same period. The figure is expected to continue expanding by 50 percent each year, it said.\nNo big surprise\nIt is no accident that mobile payment have expanded so fast in China. According to a report by eMarketer, China's lack of \"credit card culture\" has somewhat fueled the popularization of mobile payments, especially in small cities and underdeveloped areas.\nIn a remote mountain village of central China's Hunan Province, one can easily buy a hen or groceries by scanning a QR code.\nPayment and Clearing Association of China said in a report that mobile payment users in small towns and the countryside account for half of the total in China. The percentage of mobile payment users in the countryside is even higher than in provincial capitals.\n\"Mobile payment has become the norm and companies and brands cannot afford to ignore that fact,\" said Li.\nWeChat Pay has recruited several million offline vendors. Alipay announced 10 million brick-and-mortar shops have signed for their cashless life promotion.\nMobile payment has also helped improve the outdated, time-consuming services at government offices and public sectors.\nIn Xi'an, nearly 70 percent of the northwestern city's drivers pay their traffic fines via WeChat instead of wasting time queuing in long lines in police departments.\nPatients in Guangzhou are used to making an appointment with a doctor and paying by smart phone.\nStatistics from WeChat showed that over 300 cities have public service platforms that accept WeChat payments.\nBoth the Internet giants have actively expanded their services overseas since last year. Alipay can be used in several hundreds of thousands of shops in over 70 countries, while Wechat has landed in 19 countries and regions, including Japan, Thailand and Republic of Korea - most popular destinations among Chinese tourists.\n\"The door to a new world has opened, and an infinite future awaits,\" Jia said.\n"}

When, this weekend, the grandees in Davos were not fretting about financial chaos they were talking about something else: the Fourth Industrial Revolution. This is a main theme of the meeting, for the people who run the symposium there are good at picking up big ideas. So, we are going to hear a lot more about it in the coming months. But what is it?\nStart with some history. The first Industrial Revolution, which began in Britain in the late 1700s harnessed first water power, then steam, to drive a string of connected changes that enabled living standards to increase by around 2 per cent a year. The key elements were factories, railways, steamships, and agricultural advances. For the previous 1,000 years living standards in Europe had risen, at most, by less than 0.5 per cent a year, and there were long periods of stagnation and retreat. Go back further and living standards in Europe in 1000 were lower than those at the time of the Roman Empire. The world in 1900 was utterly different from that of 1800.\nIn the final years of the 19th century the second revolution was under way, with factories driven by electricity rather than steam (which made possible the moving production line), mass consumer goods, the car, the plane, the phone, television and so on. Then, from the 1970s came the personal computer, the internet, the whole bundle of technologies of the communications or IT revolution, which we are living with now. This has been dubbed the Third Industrial Revolution, because it has led to a very different economy from that of, say, the 1950s or 1960s.\nSome question whether we are moving into a new revolution or a sub-set of the previous one; I’m not sure we can know yet. What we do know is that some developments coming through now, or just round the corner, carry the possibility of change that will be as different as the internet world is from the pre-internet world. The key technologies will probably include some or all of these: artificial intelligence, robotics, the Internet of Things, big data, mobile telephony, and 3D printing.\nA couple of examples may make this clearer. Take health care. At present we rely on doctors, hospitals, pharmaceutical companies and so on to keep us well, and treat us when we are not. It is a huge chunk of the economy, between about 8 and 16 per cent of the GDP of developed countries. In the United States it is bigger than manufacturing. Now, suppose we could manage things so that people didn’t get ill. Absurd? Well, yes, but you can see bits and pieces of the technologies that might make constant monitoring of health possible: the health app stuff from Apple is a precursor of much more sophisticated kit. You can imagine a world where you don’t need a doctor to diagnose your illness because before any symptoms appear the info would have gone to a specialist treatment centre. People would be able to take responsibility for their general health.\nThe new element here is that machines talk to machines. The (expensive) human being is involved when needed, not as routine. So, not only does the cost of healthcare come down; the quality of the outcome goes up.\nDesigned by Pierpaolo Lazzarini from Italian company Jet Capsule.

Take pensions. It is, with buying a home and choosing a career, one of the big three financial decisions that people make. Yet most of us give only cursory attention to it, assuming our employer or the state will sort it out, or just hoping for the best. For those who do tailor their own plans, doing so is expensive. The scope is huge for a pension plan that requires little or no input from either provider or the individual, but simply sets aside some money every month, changes the plan as markets and tax legislation alter, and adjusts to other shifts in lifestyle and expectations. Taking the human interaction out of the process would cut costs, and that alone would massively boost returns.\nPerhaps the best way to think of the possible changes is to look for the parallels with previous industrial revolutions. Mass production has delivered an increase of around 3 per cent in manufacturing productivity year after year. It has proved much harder to increase productivity in the service industries, yet services account for a much larger proportion of output now than manufacturing. So, the key to getting richer is to use technology to improve efficiency of service industries, and that is really what the latest revolution is about.\nOne huge challenge will be to see that these developments do not disadvantage the people whose jobs are displaced. Jobs at risk include a lot of mid-skill ones in service industries. But the prize is huge … which is why we will hear a lot more about this revolution in the years ahead.\nWe use cookies to enhance your visit to our site and to bring you advertisements that might interest you.

{"title": "Avocado sales could more than double this year, helped by demand ...", "author": "CNBC", "pub_time": "2018年1月10日", "url": "https://www.cnbc.com/2018/01/10/chinas-middle-class-is-boosting-demand-for-avocados.html", "content": "Avocado sales to China are expected to more than double this year as demand continues to grow for the fruit from the country's expanding middle-class population.\n\"It appears to just double every year, from what we've seen,\" Steve Barnard, president of Oxnard, California-based Mission Produce, the world's largest distributor of avocados. \"It maybe more than double this year.\"\nAnd, the pace of growth shows no sign of slowing as more health-conscious consumers in the world's most populous nation show an interest in the \"heart-healthy\" avocados, executives say. The fruit also appeals to \"young, trendy people,\" said Barnard.\nOne big beneficiary of the growing demand is Mexico, the global leader in avocado production. Even through the U.S. market remains lucrative, avocado marketers in the Mexican state of Jalisco recently hosted a Chinese delegation in hopes of grabbing a piece of the action that now is dominated by the neighboring state of Michoacan.\n\"The Chinese market has been growing at a very fast pace,\" said Ramon Paz, an advisor for the Avocado Producers and Exporting Packers Association of Mexico (APEAM). \"Our numbers show big growth but the total absolute numbers are still modest compared to other markets like the U.S. But of course the potential is huge.\"\nAccording to Chicago-based researcher Technomic, \"Avocado has evolved into a trending ingredient worldwide and has particular resonance in China — where it's commonly known as butter fruit — due to its somewhat exotic positioning.\"\nMost of the demand in China is from \"urban consumers\" in the largest cities of Shanghai, Beijing and Guangzhou, said Paz. He said Chinese millennials who have traveled overseas also are helping to grow the market.\nStill, Paz said the U.S. market remains a priority market for Mexican shippers for several reasons, including shorter transportation time, reduced risks and generally more favorable payment arrangements too. That said, he also indicated that demand for avocados also is strong in Japan and parts of Europe.\nMexico plans to ship 1.8 billion pounds of avocados to the U.S. in the current 2017-18 season, which runs from July 1, 2017 to June 30, 2018, according to Paz. By comparison, Latin American countries as a group shipped about 76 million pounds of avocados last season to China.\nEven so, there's a risk that with all the Latin American avocados going to China it could one day increase the cost to American consumers. Mexican-grown avocados account for almost 80 percent of the creamy fruit sold in the U.S. market.\n\"It could affect it, yes, because it's pulling product out of Chile, Peru or Mexico that would would be available to ship here,\" said Barnard. And he added, \"The Chinese pay pretty good — you get a premium.\"\nThe wholesale prices of avocado in the United States more than doubled last fall due to supply hiccups in Mexico. Supplies from Mexico ended up about 20 percent below the average last season and California's harvest was about half its usual amount, according to Paz.\n\"When you see 20 percent less, it has an impact in the market,\" said Paz. \"We had a short crop basically because avocados have a tendency to produce more one year and less the next year. This year the Mexican crop is back to normal and California is forecasting a regular crop, although they had some problems with the recent wildfires.\"\nDespite last year's higher prices, demand didn't fall off as Americans appear to be willing to pay more for their avocado and guacamole. Paz estimates avocado demand in the U.S. is growing about 10 to 12 percent per year.\nExecutives say there's also demand for avocados coming from other parts of Asia as well as Europe along with countries such as Argentina, which in the past two years has increased exports by around 50 percent from Chile.\n\"Between the nutrition and the health benefits and the versatility of use, avocados is obviously one of the fastest-growing produce items in the world as far as consumption,\" said Barnard.\nMission, which is privately held, grows, packs and ships avocados all over the world and has production operations in Chile, Peru, Mexico, Colombia, Guatemala and the United States.\nSaid Barnard, \"As someone right in the middle of it, we're continuing to increase supply because we don't see this thing slowing down any.\"\nBarnard believes the retail prices of avocados in the U.S. will average \"significantly lower\" in 2018 compared with 2017. \"If you get it down to around a dollar apiece for a medium-sized fruit, the stuff will fly off the shelves.\"\nPer capita consumption in the U.S. of avocados is around 7 pounds per person, up from 4 pounds in 2010, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. And produce executives say China is just a fraction of that amount today but if it approached the American levels it would be about 10 times the amount of fruit produced in the world.\nMeantime, more avocados entering the Chinese market this year will get sent to ripening rooms in large distribution centers to allow the green fruit to become ready-to-eat. A drawback before the ripening rooms was Chinese consumers having to wait for the fruit to ripen before consuming it.\n\"The ripe fruit is growing much faster than unripe fruit, for obvious reasons — same as it does here,\" said Barnard. \"We put a ripening distribution center over there last March, and we're already adding a second one.\"\nMission Produce sends full containers of avocados packed either in Mexico, Chile or Peru to China and then refrigerates it. \"Upon demand, we'll ripen it and ship it out to the customers,\" said Barnard.\nThe ripening process for avocados is similar to bananas shipped green from Latin America that are then put into special ripening rooms to make them ideal for eating. Nature's ripening process is stimulated by using ethylene, which is a natural gas, along with ideal heat, humidity and airflow.\nMission first started selling into the Chinese market about four years ago and has two local partners for its ripe avocado brand, Mr. Avocado, in the Asian country. The U.S. company's joint venture partners include Chinese importer Lantao and a local retailer Pagoda, operator of 2,500 fruit-shop outlets.\n\"I have been in those fruit shops and you see a little bit of everybody buying,\" said Barnard. \"You see mothers and college kids. They eat pretty healthy over there — a lot of vegetables. And the fruit just adds another variable to the diet.\"\nThe Mr. Avocado brand has been using social media advertising in China to spread awareness of avocados and their health benefits. They also are doing suggestions on how to eat the fruit.\nInterestingly, the Chinese also have some avocados grown within their borders in regions such as Guangxi, located north of Vietnam. There also have been state-run farms doing trial plantings over the decades, even before significant demand existed in the domestic market.\n\"They have some trials in the south,\" said Barnard. \"We're monitoring it.\"\nHe said the Chinese \"have a big learning curve to go over\" to launch large-scale avocado production and also would face logistical challenges since production is \"in the middle of nowhere.\"\nThe avocado plant found in China is largely a tropical variety and similar to the kind found in Brazil or the Dominican Republic. It tends to have less oil and less flavor than the more popular Hass avocado.\nOne future possibility is China could start producing enough of its own crop, including the Hass variety, to cut into imports of the fruit. Yet, experts say that is unlikely to happen anytime soon.\n\"Relative to the market, it will not have very large impact ... in the next several years,\" said Paz. \"But you never know with China how big they will go with Hass avocados.\"\n\nPlaying\nShare this video...\nWatch Next...\n"}

[Photo Provided to China Daily]\nBEIJING - China's move to boost rental housing supply aims to provide a long-term solution for an overheated real estate market, analysts said.\nChina will launch pilot programs in 13 major cities, including Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou, to build rental housing on rural land, authorities said Monday. Many projects will be finished by the end of 2021, before expansion elsewhere.\nRural collective economic organizations can build and rent housing on rural land themselves or through joint ventures, according to the Ministry of Land and Resources (MLR) and the Ministry of Housing and Urban-Rural Development.\nThe move is an attempt to increase rental options and establish a housing system that is fair to both owners and tenants, analysts said.\nFor a long time, soaring property prices have put city dwellers under pressure, making housing affordability a growing problem for policy makers, prompting them to further tap the rental market to stabilize prices and curb speculation.\nAn unnamed MLR official said the move was in line with the central authorities' comments made at the Central Economic Work Conference in December that \"houses are built to be inhabited, not for speculation.\"\n\"The mentality of China's real estate regulation has changed from a short-term to a long-term one,\" said Kang Junliang with China Real Estate Association.\nLong-term measures include a national property and land registration system, market-oriented renting measures and a classified land supply regulation mechanism, according to Kang.\nChina has recently taken a set of measures to stabilize the housing market and curb speculation.\nOn July 17, authorities in the southern city of Guangzhou decided to give tenants and homeowners equal rights to local education resources. In many Chinese cities, the right to attend schools is limited to the children of homeowners rather than tenants. Guangzhou is the first top-tier Chinese city to grant such rights to tenants.\nOn July 20, a notice was issued by the Ministry of Housing and Urban-Rural Development and other government departments saying that measures would be taken in cities with net population inflows, including increasing rental housing supply and setting up a government-backed home rental service platform.\nOn Aug 4, Beijing municipal government published a document to solicit public opinions, which said individual buyers would be able to buy a share of a house but still have the full \"right of use.\"\nChen Zhi, secretary general of Beijing real estate association, said the new homes were part of the city's long-term housing controls, making the system fairer by allowing more people to buy their own homes.\nThe policy has several restrictions on buyers. Buyers and their families cannot already own homes in their name. Single people making purchases must be at least 30 years old. And a family can only apply for one home.\n\"The new housing policy clearly targets households that have difficulties in purchasing a home,\" said Liu Weimin, researcher with the State Council development research center.\nDeng Liang, a Beijing-based lawyer, said the new homes could better satisfy housing demand while curbing speculation.\nThe country will establish a market-oriented and long-term mechanism that can curb real estate bubbles and prevent erratic fluctuations, according to the statement issued after the Central Economic Work Conference.\nThe government will use land, investment, lawmaking, fiscal and taxation and financial instruments in order to achieve its aim.\nChina's property market has shown signs of cooling as prices have faltered in major cities amid tough government curbs.\n"}

Each train sells for between 400 million yuan ($58.8 million) to 500 million yuan.\nFour of the 25 new engines have already been delivered to the parent company, while two models, CR400AF and CR400BF, are going through trials on the Beijing-Shanghai high-speed rail line, the manager said.\n\"The Fuxing class trains are designed to travel at 350 kilometers per hour on average with a maximum speed of 400 km/h,\" designers at the China Academy of Railway Sciences, or CARS, revealed in a statement.\nCRRC will obviously be hoping to find overseas buyers for its new locomotives.\nZhao Hongwei, chief engineer with CARS, said the bullet trains with an average speed of 350 km/h, are suitable for long-range mainlines such as Beijing-Guangzhou line, as well as intercity lines such as the Beijing-Tianjin route.\n\"In the future, production of the new trains would definitely surge,\" Zhao was quoted as saying by Chinanews.com.\nApart from upgrading China's bullet train sector, these latest models were also designed and produced for the export market, according to the CRRC Changchun Railway Vehicles insider.\n\"They can be manufactured to the needs of foreign customers,\" the manager said. \"After all, production standards and operating environments can vary in different countries and regions.\"\nLast year, revenue from CRRC's listed arm CRRC Corp Ltd reached almost 230 billion yuan with export orders contributing more than 8 percent of overall turnover.\nThis has helped CRRC develop and grow by pumping resources into research.\n\nA man takes a photo with a Fuxing bullet train before its departure for Shanghai from Beijing. [Photo/Xinhua]\nAt first, China had to import key components from Germany's Siemens AG and Alstom Group of France. But advances in bullet technology locally are starting to change the landscape.\n\"China has been speeding up efforts to develop its own core components and standards,\" said Li Sha, an analyst at GF Securities Co Ltd. \"The initiative will accelerate the pace of replacing foreign technologies with self-developed ones.\"\nLi also pointed out that these latest high-speed models will boost business opportunities for domestic manufacturers.\nSteel for wheel construction used to be imported, but now two Chinese publicly traded companies have been certified to supply the high-grade material.\n\"Maanshan Iron & Steel Co Ltd in Anhui province and Taiyuan Heavy Industry Co Ltd in Shanxi province have been given the green light to do the work,\" Li said.\nAlready the domestic market for bullet trains in China could hit 400 billion yuan within a decade, according to the CRRC Changchun Railway Vehicles insider.\nStill, compared to Europe and Japan, China developed its high-speed rail industry late.\nYet during the past decade the country has made tremendous progress and now has the world's longest high-speed network, covering 22,340 km.\nAt the same time, Chinese companies are more competitive to Western rivals.\nA report by the BBC, the global television and media company based in the United Kingdom, showed construction costs were significantly lower than in Europe or the United States.\nXinhua contributed to this story.\n"}

It is also one of the busiest subway systems, with daily trips exceeding 10 million.\nUnionPay said it is likely that all of Shanghai subway lines will accept UnionPay mobile payments by 2018.\n\"Obviously, public transportation is one of the most frequent scenarios for payment. For payment users, frequency is perhaps the most persuasive factor besides discounts that will encourage them to accept and get used to a new payment tool,\" said Chen Jie, an analyst on consumption behavior and marketing with Shanghai Jiehua Consulting.\nPayment service providers such as Alipay and WeChat Pay started with convenience stores, small restaurants and small retailers as initial payment scenarios. Billions of yuan were spent on discounts for consumers and incentives for merchants during QR code payment promotion campaigns since 2014.\nChina UnionPay suspended the launch of QR code payments due to \"compliance concerns\", according to a previous note to the media. That ended in May 2017, when the company resumed promotion of its QR code tools after the central bank launched a series of regulations on QR code payment, giving QR code payment the full green light.\n\"In fact, UnionPay and several banks were the first to launch QR code in China,\" said Xu Yang, an e-banking specialist with China CITIC Bank Corp Ltd.\n\"Sometimes, financial institutions must put compliance issues as top priorities,\" he said.\nOn the other side of the story, Alipay and WeChat Pay together took more than 90 percent of the share in the QR code payment sector by the second quarter of 2017, when it was a 23-trillion-yuan market. That is an overwhelmingly dominant position, according to the latest quarterly report on mobile payment in China by Analysys International, a market research and information services provider.\nAccording to Li Chao, an analyst with iResearch, an internet information and market research provider, UnionPay's moves should be interpreted as providing \"infrastructure\" of the payment ecosystem.\n\"It is not just a payment services provider. As a clearing service provider, it has rich resources and can help banks, merchants, consumers to be better connected in a safer manner,\" said Li, the iResearch analyst.\nAccording to Ge Huayong, president of UnionPay, more than 40 banks now accept UnionPay's QR code payment transactions and an additional 60 or so banks are testing their systems. More than 100 million users of online platforms such as JD.com and Meituan can also pay through UnionPay QR code when spending online. More than 2.6 million merchants accept UnionPay QR code payment.\n\"In fact, when mobile payment enters into a mature stage, we believe that safety, accessibility and service quality, such as smoothness of transactions, are key advantages amid competition,\" said UnionPay in a reply to China Daily's inquiries for comments on competition in the mobile payment sector.\n\"We aim at benefiting consumers, merchants and all parties involved in the payment process. We are an open platform, and we welcome alliances,\" UnionPay added.\n"}

He explained the company is building a product that exploits a market that no one else has targeted before.\n\"We did it with the Continental GT and I think we did it with the Bentayga,\" said Airey. \"The market is responding really favorably to the car, so the product reaffirms our strategy.\"\nYet Airey said he wants to take the brand up to a new level in the world's largest premium car market, starting with branding.\n\"I think because of our long history in China, there's still a section of the market, typically our old customers, who remember the brand where it was late in the previous century. We need to make sure that we keep close relationships with all of our customers.\"\n\"We will use this as a platform to communicate specifically about the performance and dynamic element of our branding. I think the luxury element is very well in precedence into the Chinese consumers. What's so not understood is that we are still in noticeable, and actually it's the core part of our DNA.\"\nAirey said the second goal he wants to achieve is to take the brand into all of China's cities. \"As China embraces enormous economic development on a scale the world has never seen, we need to find a way to take the retailer network back, to find a brand representation and to provide an appropriate level of service for the more geographically remote parts of China.\"\n"}

{"title": "SinoTech: Trade Wars, AI Valuations, and Telecom Restrictions", "author": "Lawfare (blog)", "pub_time": "2018年4月18日", "url": "https://www.lawfareblog.com/sinotech-trade-wars-ai-valuations-and-telecom-restrictions", "content": "Tech Trade Spat Cools Off Slightly … For Now\nTensions over China’s technology trade policies appeared to cool off last week after President Xi Jinping promised thorough economic liberalization in a speech at the annual Boao Forum for Asia, a China-led conference promoted by state media and others as the “Asian Davos.” These concessions remain far from U.S. demands, however, and the Trump administration is reportedly planning to reignite the dispute by initiating $100 billion in new tariffs and establishing restrictions on Chinese investment in U.S. tech. Any new U.S. trade barriers are likely to be met by quick countermeasures from the Chinese government.\nPresident Xi’s April 9 speech outlined four specific measures that the Chinese government would adopt within the year:\nMany of Xi’s promises had already been outlined in a series of recent pledges to liberalize China’s economy, most of which have not come to fruition, leading some to express understandable skepticism about Xi’s level of commitment. At a session the next day, however, People’s Bank of China Governor Yi Gang laid out an unusually concrete reform agenda, promising to remove foreign ownership caps in banks and asset management companies and to allow majority foreign shareholding for other select financial institutions within the next few months, with vaguer reforms promised by the end of the year. On Tuesday, an official from China’s National Development and Reform Commission announced that foreign ownership caps for electric vehicle and truck manufacturers would also be removed this year.\nXi’s speech came after a week of high-profile posturing, although none of that posturing is likely to result in concrete action before late May. On April 3, the U.S. trade representative, Robert Lighthizer, proposed 25 percent tariffs on $50 billion in Chinese electronic, chemical, and industrial goods under Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974. Less than 24 hours later, China’s Ministry of Commerce announced its own $50 billion in prospective tariffs, focusing on soybeans, pork, cars, and other products economically important to states that Trump won in 2016. On April 5, President Trump directed the trade representative to consider levying a second wave of tariffs against an additional $100 billion in Chinese goods, again under Section 301.\nNeither side has taken major action since Xi’s speech, though the Commerce Ministry announced it would place a temporary 179 percent surcharge on all $1 billion in U.S. sorghum imports after a preliminary investigation concluded that subsidized American harvests were depressing domestic production. That relative calm may end soon, however, as the Trump administration is reportedly planning to propose the second wave of tariffs as early as this week, and may initiate a new Section 301 complaint against China’s cloud-computing restrictions. The White House is also reportedly considering imposing new restrictions on Chinese investment in U.S. tech companies under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, though those restrictions are not expected to be announced until early June. The administration seems determined to consolidate its arsenal of trade weapons that could be launched against China, and even appeared (at least briefly) to consider rejoining the Trans-Pacific Partnership, the multilateral Asian trade pact that President Trump railed against on the campaign trail. But the U.S. government’s path forward may also be complicated by disagreement within the executive branch, where President Trump’s advisors are reportedly sparring over the proper means to combat China’s trade policy. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross are reportedly willing to accept quick concessions that would even the United States’ trade deficit with China, whereas Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and National Trade Council Director Peter Navarro are encouraging the President to hold out for deeper reforms.\nChinese officials have promised to retaliate against any new U.S. action, and Beijing certainly possess its own range of trade tools if the spat should escalate. Although the Chinese government will soon run out of U.S. imports to tax, it could increase cyber-enabled theft, make life difficult for U.S. firms operating in China, sell off U.S. treasury bonds, or even depreciate the yuan. The Commerce Ministry has already begun to drag its feet on approving U.S. tech acquisitions, including American chipmaker Qualcomm’s takeover of Dutch competitor NXP. China has also attempted to enlist the international community, particularly the European Union, against America’s unilateral trade moves. Both the European Union and Japan have requested to join the U.S.-initiated consultation on China’s intellectual property regime. Without any official talks scheduled, progress will have to come through behind-the-scenes negotiations, which reportedly hit a wall last week after disagreements on China’s subsidies for industries favored under its “Made in China 2025” industrial plan.\nSenseTime becomes the world’s most valuable AI startup\nOn April 9, Chinese artificial intelligence startup SenseTime announced that it had raised $600 million in Series C investment funding, indicating a valuation of more than $3 billion and making SenseTime the world’s most valuable startup of its kind. The funding round was led by Chinese e-commerce titan Alibaba, which joins U.S. chipmaker Qualcomm among the firm’s primary investors. SenseTime reportedly serves more than 400 customers across various industries, including Honda, Huawei, and Weibo.\nSensetime specializes in image recognition, particularly the type of face, movement, and object recognition that Chinese law enforcement agencies and local police departments are increasingly adopting. SenseTime’s official website showcases the application of its intelligence surveillance system in Guangzhou and Yunnan, where provincial police forces have adopted facial recognition to identify criminal suspects from surveillance tapes. In Guangzhou, the video detection system is said to have “identified more than 2000 suspects … captured more than 800 people and successfully solved nearly 100 cases” in the last year alone.\nChinese authorities have rapidly expanded the use of facial recognition technologies over the past year, where it has been used to catch jaywalkers and has been embedded in glasses and monitors. On April 12, facial recognition technology allowed police in Nanchang to identify and catch a single fugitive at a pop concert among a crowd of about 50,000. The technology may now be headed overseas; Zimbabwe has agreed to begin importing facial recognition technology from China through the Belt and Road initiative.\nChina has made a strong push to develop its domestic artificial intelligence industry, focusing in recent weeks on human capital development. On April 3, China’s Ministry of Education announced an action plan for promoting artificial intelligence in universities through increased fundamental research, enhanced training of artificial intelligence talent, and additional demonstrations of AI’s capabilities in areas like education, manufacturing, and medicine. On April 4, the Chinese Ministry of Education pledged to train at least 5,000 students and 500 teachers about artificial intelligence within the next five years. Other recent efforts include a plan to build a $2.1 billion artificial intelligence technology park in western Beijing and a new annual training program on AI research launched by former Google executive Kai-Fu Lee and supported by the Education Ministry.\nCommerce and FCC Further Restrict Chinese Telecoms\nFederal agencies have continued to quietly restrict the access afforded to Chinese telecoms, blurring the line between national security concerns and economic protectionism. On Monday, April 16, the Commerce Department banned American companies from selling products to ZTE, China’s second largest telecom equipment maker, for seven years after concluding that ZTE had failed to fully enforce a 2017 settlement of criminal and civil charges. The settlement held ZTE responsible for shipping equipment to Iran and North Korea in violation of U.S. sanctions, but the Commerce Department found that ZTE had not, as promised, punished the executives involved. The United Kingdom’s National Cyber Security Centre also warned British telecom industries not to use any equipment or service provided by ZTE out of national security concerns, citing ZTE’s violation of the settlement as a contributing reason.\nOn Tuesday, the Federal Communications Commission unanimously approved a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking that would prohibit rural telecom providers from using money from the Universal Service Fund to purchase equipment from companies that pose a national security threat. The proposed rule has been widely recognized as an attempt to block ZTE and Huawei, China’s largest telecom equipment maker, from installing their equipment in American infrastructure. Huawei, which has been repeatedly targeted by American lawmakers and federal agencies, appears to be shifting its focus away from the U.S. market.\nIn Other News\nAnalysis & Commentary\nElsewhere on Lawfare, Hayley Evans provides context and a synopsis of last week’s U.N. GGE meeting on autonomous weapons; Ashley Deeks summarizes her article on the lessons that military adapters of predictive algorithms could learn from the criminal justice context; Elsa Kania analyzes China’s mercurial approach to lethal autonomous weapons; and Tim Maurer discusses his new book on “Cyber Mercenaries” with Benjamin Wittes on the Lawfare Podcast. At Just Security, Maya Wang argues that China’s surveillance state should warn U.S. lawmakers of the dangers of weak privacy protections.\nAt Brookings, David Dollar parses President Xi’s Boao Forum speech. Mark Muro, Jacob Whiton, and Robert Maxim examine “How China’s proposed tariffs could affect U.S. workers and industries.” Rogier Creemers, Graham Webster, Abigail Coplin, and Paul Triolo of New America summarize and translate the Chinese State Intellectual Property Office’s new restrictions on intellectual property transfers to foreign parties. In separate articles, William Alan Reinsch of the Center for Strategic and International Studies, Professors Bill Kirby and Willy Shih of the Harvard Business School, and Zhiwei Zhang in The Diplomat, examine the likely outcomes of the recent trade blows.

[Peng Bin/For China Daily]\n\"In cities like Chengdu, I can still pursue my dreams, but without all the struggling,\" said the 24-year-old graduate.\nThis year, the number of China's college graduates is expected to reach 7.95 million, an increase of 300,000 on last year, according to the Ministry of Education.\nOther than swarming into megacities such as Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou, more students want to start their careers in second-tier cities, including the provincial capitals and coastal cities, according to a recent survey.\nThe survey carried out by Zhaopin.com, one of China's leading recruitment websites, showed that 37.5 percent of China's new college graduates in 2017 wanted to work in second-tier cities, while 29.9 percent preferred top-tier cities.\n\"A few years ago, only a couple of students graduating from universities outside Chongqing came for our job interview, but this year we have a long queue of people with master's and doctoral degrees from Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou,\" said Huang Zuge, an HR official in a Chongqing internet company.\nBooming economy\nStatistics from the National Bureau of Statistics showed that besides Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou and Shenzhen, eight smaller metropolises stepped into China's 1-trillion-yuan ($148 billion) GDP club in 2016, including Chongqing, Chengdu, Wuhan, Suzhou and Hangzhou.\nThe rapid economic development of second-tier cities was the main factor attracting fresh graduates, said Su Hainan, vice president of the China Association for Labor Studies.\nHangzhou, capital of East China's Zhejiang province and host city of the 2016 G20 summit, hit a record with double-digit GDP growth for seven consecutive quarters in 2015 and 2016.\nAs the city where China's e-commerce giant Alibaba is located, Hangzhou is famous for its online business development. The export of its cross-border e-commerce reached $5.27 billion from January to November of 2016.\nChengdu, capital of Sichuan, is home to offices for 278 Fortune Global 500 companies, and also a key city in China's Belt and Road Initiative.\n\"I think Chengdu will continue to benefit from the Belt and Road Initiative, and I see ample opportunities in trades with the advent of the China (Sichuan) Pilot Free Trade Zone,\" Xu said.\nSichuan's free trade zone was launched this April, and over 7,000 new companies have registered in Chengdu during the past three months.\nFavorable policy\nBesides economic growth, the implementation of favorable employment policy in these cities is appealing to new college graduates.\nChangsha, capital city of central China's Hunan province, provides housing and living subsidies from 6,000 to 15,000 yuan per year for graduates with different types of degree.\nThose with doctoral degrees who work in Changsha can get 60,000 yuan of subsidies when they purchase their first residence in the city.\nLiu Xuezhi, an analyst with the Bank of Communications, said adopting favorable employment policies met the need for innovative development in second-tier cities.\nThe government of Southwest China's Chongqing Municipality has financed 595 entrepreneurial programs, disbursing 16 million yuan of subsidies and reducing 30 million yuan of guarantee fees since 2015, according to the city's Employment Service and Administration Department.\nHigh-quality human resources are becoming a strong drive in the industrial transformation and upgrading of middle-level cities, said Liu Yuanchun, an economist and vice-president of Renmin University of China.\n\n"}

Liu, chief economic adviser to the Chinese government and one of the 25 most powerful people in the Politburo, was there to deliver a speech on the way forward for China’s economic programme over the next five years.\nHe did not disappoint. To a roomful of attendees, Liu promised in Chinese that some reforms “will exceed the expectations of the international community”.\nAt a meeting of the country’s parliament and political advisory body next month, Liu, a 66-year-old Beijing native, is likely to be promoted to become one of four vice premiers working nominally under Premier Li Keqiang.\nChina’s economic mastermind Liu He steps out onto centre-stage at Davos\nLiu, who attended Harvard’s Kennedy School and Seton Hall University in New Jersey, will be one of the country’s most powerful vice-premiers in two decades, according to analysts, scholars and economists who know him.\nThe Chinese president may delegate much of China’s economic management to Liu’s team, “largely bypassing the premier”, said Steve Tsang, director of the SOAS China Institute in London and author of China in the Xi Jinping Era. “Liu is unlikely to put forth any plan which he thinks President Xi Jinping will not approve, or like.”\nLiu will continue to direct the Office of the Central Leading Group on Financial and Economic Affairs – its address is a Beijing postbox – which functions like the US government’s National Economic Council. According to a source familiar with government operations, he will also chair the Financial Stability and Development Commission, a new agency that supersedes all financial regulators, responsible for overseeing regulation and reducing “rhino risks”, as highly leveraged corporate borrowers are called.\n\nHis team will comprise economic technocrats drawn from China’s banking and financial system, appointed to various senior positions to oversee the country’s central bank, lenders, as well as the stockbroking and insurance industries.\nWhile the final appointments will not be known until parliament meets from March 3 until March 15, several names have already been touted in Beijing’s policymaking circles as likely candidates.\nOpinion: is growing debt the biggest risk for China’s economy?\nAmong them are the current bank regulator Guo Shuqing, securities regulator Liu Shiyu, deputy central bank governor Yi Gang, state planning director He Lifeng, state assets custodian Xiao Yaqing and Ding Xuedong, deputy secretary general of the State Council.\nWith five doctorates between the six, every member of this elite team of econocrats has spent the most part of their careers managing either a state entity, a bank or a financial services company. At least three among them speak English fluently.\n“The team being put together looks like a strong one,” Tsang said. “They should be in a position to put in place a reform programme that seeks to rebalance the economy and reduce risk at the same time.”\n\nLiu spent four years at two American universities, an experience that puts him in a unique position to deal with a US government that has turned increasingly more hostile towards Beijing, with Donald Trump’s administration labelling China a “strategic competitor”. Trump has also been vacillating between his apparent fondness for Xi – he called the Chinese president a “very special man” after being flattered and wooed during his November 2017 visit to China – and his pre-election promise to slap tariffs on Chinese exports.\nWhy China must wake up to demographic reality\nThe biggest economic challenges confronting Liu’s team will be domestic. China’s breakneck growth – at an average clip of 9.8 per cent every quarter since March 1992, when data became available – has turned its economy into the world’s second-largest. But the quarterly growth pace has slowed to an average of 7.2 per cent in the past five years under the watch of Xi and Li, a situation the government called the “new normal”.\nAdding to the litany of economic challenges is a rapidly ageing population and a birth rate that is too low to replenish the country’s workforce, a widening wealth gap especially between the five biggest cities and the remainder of the country, mounting debt among local provincial governments, runaway home prices and rampant financial irregularities – none of which can be resolved in the short term.\n“No one should think this is an easy job, but it has been made harder by China’s unwillingness to tackle some of these issues years ago,” said Fraser Howie, co-author of “Red Capitalism: The Fragile Financial Foundations of China’s Extraordinary Rise”, who added that the first test would be how China reins in debt. The team faces a “far more complex” financial system than it ever was and “the days of easy growth are over”, he said.\nLoneliness: the latest economic niche opening up in China\nOne in four of the mainland population will be 60 years or older by 2030, from the current 16.7 per cent, according to census data. That will exert pressures on the pension system, and cause wages to soar because the workforce cannot be replenished quickly enough to meet demand.\nDebt ballooned over a decade to 163.4 per cent of economic output at the end of 2017. That compares with 73.3 per cent in the US and 53.8 per cent in Germany, according to the Bank of International Settlements, enough of a major concern for Moody’s and S&P to downgrade China’s sovereign credit rating for the first time in two decades.\n“Indebted, old countries do not grow,” said Derek Scissors, a resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute and chief economist at China Beige Book, a New York-based research group. “The next five years will probably be OK, but the economy is headed in the wrong direction.”\nAlso significant is next month’s retirement of Zhou Xiaochuan, the septuagenarian former chemical engineer and China’s central bank governor for 15 years through the first term of Xi’s presidency.\nThe central bank works as the government’s policy organ, without a charter of independence, so the governor is not so much a formulator of monetary policy as its implementer. Zhou, with a penchant for delivering hour-long, off-the-cuff lectures on macroeconomics – in either Mandarin or English – is China’s longest serving central banker, and the most authoritative and articulate explainer of the country’s monetary policy.\nChina provinces lower targets after Xi says go for quality growth\nAt least three of the six potential members of Liu’s elite team worked under Zhou – Guo Shuqing as the central bank’s foreign exchange administrator, Yi Gang after he joined the People’s Bank of China in 2004 as assistant governor, while Liu Shiyu was Zhou’s chief of staff in 2002, and later assistant governor.\n\nGuo, 62, is said to be the front runner as the incoming governor of the People’s Bank of China. His resume includes provincial governments in Guizhou and Shandong, heading the regulatory bodies for stocks and banks, and four years as enforcer of China’s foreign exchange controls.\nGuo likes to get things done quickly without much consideration for interest groups, according to China Banking Regulatory Commission officials, who declined to give their names.\nThat style may resonate with Liu. When Communist Party elders cited the 2008 global financial crisis as proof that China’s economic reforms since 1978 had gone awry, Liu dismissed people with those views as “a small minority”, according to a cable by former US ambassador to China Clark “Sandy” Randt that was disclosed by WikiLeaks.\nChina’s top economic aide fails to inspire at Davos\nThis working style may also adhere to President Xi’s priorities, which are to ensure political stability whilst untangling the complex web of woes entrapping China’s economy, said American Enterprise Institute’s Scissors.\n“Xi could initiate bold changes, but he has made his preference clear – state control is more valuable than productivity,” Scissors said. “His government does not appear to have an economic agenda other than deal with risks created by [his predecessor],” he said.\nThe Chinese leadership outlined three key tasks over the next three years during its annual Central Economic Work Conference in December: risk prevention, poverty reduction and pollution control.\nThe results of pollution control are already apparent. Boilers and heating systems in Hebei province, which surrounds Beijing, were forced to switch to natural gas from coal to reduce the smog that cloaks the Chinese capital every winter, even as millions of rural residents were caught unprepared for the conversion. The result was to transform Beijing from one of China’s most polluted cities to one with the best air quality.\nSimilarly, in banking and finance, regulators worked in concert to reduce risk on the financial system. Guo as bank regulator uncovered 59,700 cases of irregularities among Chinese lenders involving 17.7 trillion yuan (US$2.7 trillion), and slapped 1,877 banks with 2.9 billion yuan in fines. Liu Shiyu, as securities regulator, gave a series of well-publicised tongue lashings to listed companies engaged in leveraged buyouts, while the insurance regulator was fired for allowing insurance policies to be used as war chests to finance takeovers.\n\nIn Liu He, China has an experienced hand at dealing with the risks accumulated over a decade of financial innovation and post-crisis economic stimulus. In 2012 research titled Comparative Study on the Two Global Crisis, he laid out the steps for dealing with risks: set a bottom line; prepare for the worst possible scenario; and maximise national interest by grasping strategic opportunities. Three years later he called for the creation of a regulatory regime with teeth, which paved the way for crackdowns on debt, including placing private conglomerates like Anbang Group, Fosun Group, HNA Group and Wanda Group under scrutiny.\n“Reform mindset and approaches are necessary to solve long-term structural problems while surgeries are needed to tackle short-term risk,” Liu wrote in the Chinese preface of Financial Supervision in the 21st Century, a book compiled by the Dutch central bank to reflect on the 2008 global financial crisis.\nXi Jinping’s war on shadow banking spills over, rocking China’s financial sector\nStrategies such as the Belt and Road Initiative, supply-side reforms, the shift to consumption-driven growth and China’s rush to defend globalisation can trace their roots to the 2012 research project led by Liu.\n“The world has entered a long process of inadequate demand and deleveraging after the [2008] crisis. Our strategic opportunities are mainly the huge lift of domestic market to drive a global economic recovery, acquisition of technologies of developed countries and infrastructure investment,” according to Comparative Study on the Two Global Crisis.\nTsang said: “He will have to steer a course between keeping the party in the driving seat and making the private sector vibrant. Only time will tell if he can square this circle and for how long.”\nYou are signed up. We think you'd also like\n"}

The brand's sales rose with a double-digit growth rate to 46,016 vehicles last month. Since the beginning of the year, sales in China increased by 27.8 percent to 488,915 vehicles.\n\"About 71 percent of the delivered Mercedes-Benz were China-made products,\" local media cited Duan Jianjun, executive vice-president for sales and marketing of Beijing Mercedes-Benz Sales Service Co Ltd, as saying on Friday in Guangzhou.\nAudi has achieved its highest growth rate to date this year, with sales up 14.5 percent in China. With 53,828 automobiles sold, this year saw the best October sales month in Audi history. Since January, the automaker sold 472,498 cars in China.\nJaguar Land Rover's China sales soared almost 28 percent to 488,915 vehicles in the first ten months, more than its total sales in 2016. A total of 12,321 Jaguars and Land Rovers were sold in the country last month, up 12 percent year-on-year.\nAn optimistic outlook for the world's largest market is shared among the premium automakers, and they pin their hopes on the continued fast expansion of the Chinese luxury segment for next year's growth.\nJaguar Land Rover, Volvo and BMW in particular share a similar optimistic vision for China's luxury car market development in the future, expecting their big year in 2018.\nFrank Wittemann, president of Jaguar Land Rover Integrated Marketing Sales and Service told China Daily: \"The growth in the premium market is fast, and the annual growth rate could be 10 percent this year. Given a 5 to 6 percent growth rate year-on-year is healthy, we are not worried about development.\n\"Competition is fierce in the Chinese market. We need to be stronger and stronger, and compete in the right way. We will grow in a sustainable, qualitative way, rather than competing in a price war.\"\nChinese customers are showing their preference more and more for premium brands with a unique character and products with personality, Yuan Xiaolin, senior vice-president of Volvo Car Group, said in an interview with China Daily.\n\"The performance in China is beyond the group's earlier expectation. We are progressing in line with the market trend,\" Yuan said.\nFrom January to October, the Chinese-owned Swedish brand's sales were equivalent to those in the whole of 2016, with its sales volume growth reaching 30 percent year-on-year. Huge market potential exists for the future Chinese automobile industry, as the luxury segment contributes a relatively small portion of the world's largest market, according to Duan at Beijing Mercedes-Benz Sales Service.\nDuan said: \"The deliveries of luxury automobiles contributed less than 10 percent to the overall Chinese market. Compared with the premium segment's 15 to 30 percent market share in mature markets, there will be great room for development.\"\n"}

{"title": "Not a zero-sum game: global governance must adapt to the new US ...", "author": "South China Morning Post", "pub_time": "2018年1月16日", "url": "http://www.scmp.com/comment/insight-opinion/article/2128429/not-zero-sum-game-global-governance-must-adapt-new-us-china", "content": "China Conference 2018\nDaniel Russel says new models of global governance that promote healthy competition as well as cooperation on big challenges are needed to address the changing dynamics between the US and China, and that the latter’s new regional initiatives could be a road test of the country’s emergence as a world leader\nComments:\n\nHong Kong is an ideal place to examine the issues of China, the US and global governance. Few places have benefited more than Hong Kong has from two of the major developments of our era: China’s emergence as an economic powerhouse and the globalisation of the world economy.\nOne of the reasons that Hong Kong has been effective in facilitating China’s integration into the international economy is its long-standing status as an international financial centre. That status is based on its openness to commerce and foreign investment, its independent and professional legal system, its robust and transparent regulatory regimes – and, of course, its open press environment and high-quality publications.\nSo not only has Hong Kong done well for itself, but its transparency, openness and adherence to international norms have also helped China navigate, and thrive, in the present-day international system.\nMany of Hong Kong’s advantages derive from the “one country, two systems” framework, which aim to protect the core values of freedom, human rights, democracy, the rule of law and clean governance. Hong Kong has had to deal with some pressure from within and without on the high degree of autonomy accorded to it under the Basic Law. So, it’s important to bear in mind that both elements of Hong Kong’s status – the “one country” part and the “two systems” part – are essential to sustaining its comparative advantages.\n\nBut the broader point is that since the launch of economic reforms in 1978, China, and by extension Hong Kong, have benefited immensely from the existing international system. Over time, China has become both a member, and a key beneficiary, of most international regimes. And it’s no accident that China’s economic boom accelerated following its accession to the World Trade Organisation in 2001.\nBut China is changing, and changing quickly. The world and its international institutions and regimes have sometimes been slow to adjust. China has sometimes been seen as reluctant to “pay its dues”.\nChina has gone from borrower to lender, from “hide and bide” to “national rejuvenation” and the “China dream”. Some 700 million of its citizens have been lifted out of poverty. China has sent astronauts to space, and is preparing to put a man on the moon. The People’s Liberation Army is rapidly modernising – its third aircraft carrier is reportedly under construction. China is also working to transform itself from the “world’s factory” to a centre of technological innovation and development.\nThere’s a lot for China to be proud of. But the expectations – and the challenges – are immense.\nThe interdependence of the Chinese and American economies is unprecedented. And yet, complementarity between the Chinese and American economies – which benefited both China and the United States – is decreasing, while competition for 21st century advantage in sectors such as artificial intelligence, robotics, nanotechnology, renewable energy technology, semiconductors, computer engineering and biotechnology is rapidly increasing.\nAs the economic complementarity of previous decades gradually dissipates, greater stress is placed on both the bilateral relationship and the global system. What that means is that upgrading global governance models to meet these new dynamics has assumed added importance.\nTo put this simply – we urgently need to develop models of global governance that allow the US and China to engage in healthy competition, while continuing to cooperate on big global challenges like climate change, global health, terrorism, non-proliferation, cyberspace and regional hotspots.\nOne criticism of the current global governance system is that it has generally been slow to adjust, and slow to grant China a voice commensurate with its growing stature. As much as China has benefited from the global governance rules and institutions, Henry Kissinger pointed out that China is adjusting to an international system that was developed in its absence, on the basis of a programme it didn’t participate in developing.\nSo reform is needed, and needed for a number of reasons. The international system is under stress, not only due to China’s rise, but also from globalisation, automation, artificial intelligence and information technology, from changes so seismic we have only begun to grasp their impact. As a result of these changes, it is very much my view that global governance is approaching a crossroads.\nFor one thing, shifting attitudes in both the United States and China have contributed to dissatisfaction with the current nature of the global governance system. But the sources of US and Chinese discontent are different.\nToday in the US, there is a new (and worrisome) scepticism about the benefits from global engagement, leadership, and participation in international institutions. Look at the US withdrawal from the Trans-Pacific Partnership and the broader rejection of multilateral trade arrangements. (Many countries are waiting with some trepidation to hear what President Donald Trump is going to say at Davos this month.)\nOr take the withdrawal from the Paris agreement on climate change. Or the recently released national security strategy, which downplayed America’s support for universal values in favour of a return to “America first” nationalism. This is part of a broader backlash against globalisation.\n\nAt the same time, today in China, new capabilities, new investments, along with a new nationalism, are feeding a more ambitious, self-interested global engagement. We see perhaps less humility and more entitlement – an understandable sense that China’s increasing strength entitles it to a greater say, or a leading role, in international institutions.\nThis shift in attitudes has also has spurred China to push forward with alternative regional institutions. Both the Belt and Road Initiative and the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank can be seen in this light.\nChina has been suspicious of Washington’s defence of a status quo that locks in US advantages. Some in China view US efforts and emphasis on “rules of the road” as attempts to contain China or threaten Communist Party control.\nChina also sometimes sees opportunism and hypocrisy in US efforts to use global governance, for example, the insistence that China abide by the terms of the UN Convention on Law of the Sea in the South China Sea when the US itself has not ratified the treaty.\nThese negative perceptions – the suspicion that global norms and institutions are being unfairly used to undermine Beijing’s interests – are exacerbated because China is a latecomer to global engagement and is excluded from some institutions and is under-represented in others.\nThe US, meanwhile, has been suspicious of what it sees as efforts by China to undermine global institutions, to “freeride” or exploit loopholes and protections, and to exempt itself from rules and norms.\nThe recent national security strategy bluntly declares that China seeks to displace the United States in Asia and reorder the region in its favour. It argues that past support for China’s rise, and for hopes for its integration into the post-war international order, were mistaken. That China is contesting America’s geopolitical advantages and trying to manipulate the international order.\nStrong stuff.\n\nSo where does that leave us?\nI don’t subscribe to the Thucydides Trap theory of strategic rivalry – that conflict between an established power and a rising power is inevitable. But the fact that it is “not inevitable” does not mean that it’s impossible.\nEven Graham Allison says that avoiding the Thucydides Trap requires leaders to make good decisions. Exercising good judgment will be ever more critical if the US charts a more self-interested, some might say nationalist, foreign policy, at the same time that China increases its global engagement.\nTo deal with these challenges and risks, both China and the US must find a way to surmount their mutual suspicions.\nSpecifically, they need to identify a common interest in building a global governance system that accommodates China’s legitimate interests, but also preserves the foundations of a rules-based international order that is respectful of universal rights and freedoms. Doing so is essential, because the alternative is so dangerous. We face the risk of a shift towards a more zero-sum, “blood and soil”, cutthroat world – a world we don’t want to live in.\nProfessor Joe Nye of Harvard made the point that the risk we should focus on isn’t really the Thucydides Trap. It’s the risk that the US might curtail its global leadership and participation in international institutions, while China approaches global engagement and international institutions largely as a means to satisfy so-called core interests and national goals.\nNo country should be expected to ignore or abandon its own interests. But the world can’t afford for major powers to neglect their global responsibilities.\nThat means that now is the time for both the US and China to check their worst impulses when it comes to global governance. Because if the US were to back away from multilateral diplomacy and organisations, and if China were to engage selectively with an eye to tactical advantage and protecting “core interests”, we would find ourselves in a more unstable world.\nThe key here is that the US should not walk away from its global leadership responsibilities, and China should seek to ensure that its multilateral efforts complement, not undermine, existing global governance institutions.\nIt is clear that avoiding a zero-sum world is a project that will take concerted efforts in both Washington and Beijing.\n\nI’m the first to admit that there is a lot that the Trump administration will need to do to show that “America first” does not lead to “America alone” and that Washington is up to the challenges that automation and the knowledge economy pose to US prosperity and global leadership. There is plenty that the US should do. But since I am in Hong Kong, let me focus on China.\nXi Jinping has set high expectations at home and abroad. Domestically, he set ambitious twin centenary goals. Internationally, he’s set a high bar in his Davos speech last year and talk of a “community of common destiny”.\nChina has in fact begun to make greater contributions to multilateral organisations, and to international security efforts like anti-piracy patrols in the Gulf of Aden and the recently established standby force that the UN can draw on for peacekeeping operations.\n\nXi has also set in motion major international development initiatives that I’ve mentioned – the Belt and Road Initiative, the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, and the BRICS development bank. These and other commitments put China forward both as a model and a leader for the developing world.\nTo meet the high expectations set forth by Xi, China will have to make a sustained effort to win the trust and confidence of its international partners.\nI have no doubt that China has the material capacity to achieve Xi’s ambitious agenda, but some big questions are outstanding: Is China willing to take on significant responsibility for providing global goods and shouldering international burdens, often well beyond the specific needs of China as a nation? Is Beijing willing to show restraint, accept limits, and abide by international standards, even at the expense of some short-term advantage to China?\nAnd, while I’m on sensitive ground here, let me raise a point that many of China’s friends in the West find particularly troubling: what will be the impact on prospects for regional or global leadership of Beijing’s use of technology and big data for repressive political and social control at home?\nI ask these questions with humility because the answers are going to matter. These are prerequisites for other countries’ acceptance of an expanded Chinese leadership role in global governance over the long term.\nAccording to the most recent Pew Poll in Asia, the response throughout major countries in the region to the question “How much confidence do you have in the Chinese president to do the right thing regarding world affairs?” was worryingly low – I’m talking single digits in many cases.\nIt’s important to get those numbers up. And my own belief is that it’s the decisions and behaviour of the Chinese government and companies that can do that, rather than speeches and white papers and paid inserts in foreign newspapers.\nAt the China Conference, we had a good session on China’s highest-profile multilateral project – the Belt and Road Initiative. This initiative is a key indicator of whether China’s growing international engagement is primarily about satisfying its national interests, or whether Beijing seeks to create a more prosperous, interconnected and win-win Eurasia through multilateral cooperation.\nNow, not all of the international scepticism about the Belt and Road Initiative may be justified. There are some significant cultural differences at play. In the US, initiatives are launched with blueprints and handouts and detailed specifics and frequently-asked questions. In China, initiatives are presented as broad strategic directives from the political leadership with policy specifics to be developed over time. So in many cases, the opacity of new Chinese initiatives is met with scepticism in the West, and their vagueness and lack of transparency means that people are free to let their suspicions run wild.\nThis makes the Belt and Road Initiative something of a “Rorschach test” of international attitudes towards China.\nIs the Belt and Road Initiative about co-opting and coercing its neighbours? Or is it about promoting connectivity and commerce based on mutual interest and mutual benefit?\nIs it neocolonialism? Part of a Chinese sphere of influence via state capitalism? A geostrategic play to establish military bases for a blue-water navy and political leverage through crushing debt?\nOr is it a sensible – even generous – investment of China’s excess capital and capacity? A programme to build up both China’s underdeveloped western regions and create more dependable supply lines and smoother trade networks to bring its goods to market?\nIs it a 21st century version of the Marshall Plan that will improve infrastructure and connectivity throughout Eurasia that benefits everyone?\nIt makes sense for China to work to prove the positive case, and for the US and other international partners to help steer the Belt and Road Initiative in that direction. And to be successful, we have to remember that there is both a practical and a moral component to leadership.\nFor the Belt and Road Initiative, that means first demonstrating that China can deal successfully with the complex challenges of managing risk, local politics, financing, and that it can successfully operate in areas that others – Russia, India, the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, the European Union – may consider to be within their “spheres of influence”. That is the practical side.\nSecondly, it means that the vision of the initiative – connectivity and integration – must be credible and embraced by other countries.\nIt also means that the initiative mustn’t be marred by projects that are tainted by problems and scandals. As we’ve already seen in Nepal, for example, where a US$2.5 billion deal for a hydroelectric plant was scrapped because the contract was awarded in an extra-legal manner, practical and moral considerations can present quite a challenge.\nJust recently, I read a good editorial in the Post citing Belt and Road Initiative problems throughout South Asia and urging sensitivity and respect in approaching China’s neighbours.\nThere are important steps that China can take to avoid these pitfalls and prove that the Belt and Road Initiative is more than geopolitical power play.\nThese include establishing responsible financial, environmental and labour standards for projects under the initiative, and ensuring that projects are transparent and inclusive with open, competitive bidding. Clear criteria for project selection and the establishment of anti-corruption standards commensurate with the Communist Party’s own domestic policies would go a long way to enhancing the initiative’s credibility.\nThe Belt and Road Initiative is also an area where we could potentially see a marriage between China’s infrastructure development prowess and the United States’ strengths in services: risk management, financial services, information technology, and so on. China can also show that the programme is inclusive by ensuring that foreign companies, both manufacturers and service providers, are involved.\nI’ve used the Belt and Road Initiative as an example of how China can take positive steps to deepen its global engagement through new initiatives. And these new initiatives serve as laboratories where China can learn to work successfully with foreign partners in an international environment.\nBut at the same time, it’s important to avoid undermining the existing regional and global institutions that have widespread international support.\nYes, our models and mechanisms for global governance should be updated to reflect changing international realities and new challenges of the 21st century, but not at the expense of the important first principles that drove the creation of these institutions in the first place.\nMy friend and colleague, Kevin Rudd, the former prime minister of Australia, made some important points on this topic in a speech at Peking University last month. He was building on recommendations in an Asia Society Policy Institute report on “Preserving the Long Peace in Asia”.\nThe first is that such institutions should play a binding role, drawing states to greater convergence around shared interests.\nSecond, is that international institutions should seek to mitigate historical distrust and circumvent historical patterns, such as the Thucydides Trap, by fostering opportunities for strategic dialogue.\nThird, is that institutions should work to facilitate better management of crises and disputes.\nAnd finally, that these institutions should develop the capacity to set forward-looking agendas to deal with future challenges.\nThese recommendations are a good reminder that there are both preventive and progressive rationales for good global governance. The US and China can work together in multilateral institutions, and work to improve them, not only to prevent problems but also to make progress on shared global objectives.\nBut to do this, the US and China must manage the differences in perspective and the mutual suspicions that have hampered our ability to achieve consensus on global governance issues in the past.\n\nLet me give you an example of a domain that is desperately in need of global norms: cyberspace. This is a void that urgently needs to be filled, but the US and China differ even on the definition of the problem, let alone the solution: Is the goal to protect cross-border information flow or to block it?\nIs our goal a free and open internet or cyber sovereignty and data localisation? For the US, cybersecurity doesn’t include control of content. For China, controlling content is the whole point. It is no easy matter for the US and China to find common ground sufficient to forge international consensus on cyber norms.\nLet me give you another example that doesn’t involve technology: maritime resources. Like climate change in 2016, US-China cooperation on ocean sustainability can form the nucleus of meaningful international cooperation. Overfishing, much of it illegal and unreported, has depleted fish stocks in the Pacific and is propelling the world towards a major food crisis. It’s not just that China has 1.3 billion people. It’s that so many of them have discovered sushi!\nTo make things worse, in addition to competing commercial considerations, China and its neighbours have sensitive political disputes over sovereignty claims – disputes that have resulted in large-scale environmental damage as claimants compete to strengthen shoals and reefs by dredging and reclamation on a huge scale and at the expense of regional security and stability.\n\nCyberspace and maritime space present tough issues, but they are important examples that remind us that strong institutions and international arrangements, which are valuable in the own right, also serve as a hedge against strategic rivalry.\nAnd let’s make sure we are distinguishing between healthy competition, which tends to brings out the best in all parties, and strategic rivalry, which tends to bring out the worst. No country benefits from US-China strategic rivalry.\nOur approach to global governance has to be rooted in recognition that all of us share a deep interest in effectively managing global challenges: that means safeguarding cyberspace, sustaining the ocean’s resources, preventing macroeconomic instability and financial upheaval, promoting trade and investment, dealing with global public health risks like pandemics, slowing and mitigating climate change, countering weapons of mass destruction proliferation, and combating terrorism and piracy.\nMy own career in diplomacy, including service at the United Nations, and my experience at high-level multilateral meetings with president Barack Obama and Secretaries Hillary Clinton and John Kerry have all taught me this: global governance is not an abstraction, and good global governance will not come about of its own accord.\nThe US, China and the community of nations need to work in multilateral forums and work on multilateral instruments, both to prevent a dangerous future and to build a better one.\nDaniel Russel, a former assistant secretary of state for East Asian and Pacific affairs at the US State Department, is currently diplomat in residence and senior fellow at the Asia Society Policy Institute.

[Photo/IC]\nWhat was behind the decision by Samsung to acquire Harman?\nBoth companies, Harman and Samsung, are very complementary. Harman brings the whole connected car and audio management system (to the partnership).\nSamsung brings car electronics, semiconductor technology, sensors, displays, 5G network connectivity and artificial intelligence. So, if you combine these two, you have the most comprehensive electronics system and software scope in the industry.\nHow does this acquisition influence Harman's business?\nThis new relationship is extremely powerful for all our automakers, our B2B clients and consumers. The implications of this acquisition will continue for years to come.\nSamsung is a large company with global scale, and Harman is a market leader with some of the best technologies for audio and the connected car. The acquisition also enables Harman to quickly get scale to expand its products and solutions with access to some of the best research and development resources in the world.\nAt the same time, Samsung has increased its capability growth in connectivity technologies. Speed and scale are important for connectivity technologies because they have wide applications.\nBy collaborating with Chinese brands, will Harman expand faster here?\nWe have a mandate from Samsung to continue our business relationships with all our partners and automotive customers. We are partnering today with Huawei (Technologies Co Ltd) although they compete with Samsung.\nWe announced a great new partnership with Baidu (Inc), and we will jointly develop artificial intelligence systems for car and consumer audio products. And we will continue to partner with TV and telephone companies.\nHarman works as a trusted partner with trusted \"firewalls\" between the portions of our business that are competitive or require confidentiality.\nInterestingly, Samsung already operates in this fashion. For example, while competing with Apple in the smartphone market, they are also the biggest supplier to the company. In cooperating with Chinese brands, we are not changing our strategy.\nHarman is regarded as an audio company. Why is it transforming into a connectivity technology provider?\nHarman has been around for 70 years and knows the secret to long-term success is the ability to evolve and re-invent. Innovation is part of the company's DNA.\nAnother common thread is connectivity in technological innovation across all our businesses. This means in the home, in the car and in enterprise.\nA company with scale can innovate with the latest technology at a lower price.\nWhat is your view on the latest connectivity technology and artificial intelligence?\nThe technology involved in virtual reality and augmented reality is not new. But it was not ready for commercial application, particularly in the automotive market. Now Harman is able to bring these solutions to automakers.\nFor example, our augmented reality solution enables drivers to receive tips on navigation or warnings of road conditions ahead on a display screen. (We combine this with) \"contextual\" navigational prompts, such as an arrow telling you to turn left.\nThis would be overlaid directly on to a live camera view of the road ahead, so you would be able to see exactly which street you would need to turn at. Again, this can be combined with other technologies like head-up displays or prompts projected on to the windscreen.\nIt is a much safer option because the driver does not have to take his, or her, eyes off the road. Yet he or she can still get realistic navigational prompts.\nOf course, solutions such as these require connectivity technologies. Certainly, automated driving is not possible without high-speed connectivity. So Harman and Samsung are very focused in addressing these areas.\nWe will be the world leader in bringing these solutions to the market.\nHarman has a wide range of brands, so what is your management strategy?\nConsumers want different products that meet the demands of various scenarios in cars, at home and using phones. Young consumers might start off buying Harman entry-level products.\nBut when their wealth accumulates, they will buy premium products from a Harman brand.\nOur multibrand strategy has been very successful because we can fulfill the needs of customers at every price point and with labels that appeal to different segments of the market.\nThe company appears to be expanding into more affordable markets. What are the reasons behind that move?\nHarman made a decision 10 years ago that the company would be very good at delivering technology in luxury cars. But for the company to grow, the luxury segment is not enough.\nAccelerated growth will come from the mid and entry markets. China is a great example of that with companies like Guangzhou Automotive, Shanghai Automotive Industry Corporation (SAIC), BYD, BMW Brilliance (BMW JV), Dongfeng and Chery. We are partners with all of them.\nBecause our technology platforms are scalable, we can offer automakers a range of solutions that meet the needs of entry segment cars all the way to the most feature-rich.\nAn automaker can grow its business along with us.\nWe are ubiquitous and supply not only Western automakers but also Chinese customers. This reflects our ability to be competitive and to scale our solutions.\nHow has Harman adapted to the trend that China and the global market are becoming integrated?\nWe are an innovative company. We have global R&D in the country and it is not just for China, but for the whole world. We are serving global customers from China such as BMW, Mercedes-Benz and others.\nWe also develop our staff here by placing them abroad. Other members of staff come to China from other parts of our business. Regardless of where our people sit, we always have one philosophy.\nQuite simply, all our best technologies, whether developed in China or elsewhere, are offered to all our customers. This has been a big part of our success worldwide from China.\nHow do you strike a balance between life and work?\nI don't think work and life balance is the same for everyone. For people like us, our spouse, our family has to be very understanding because our job, our responsibility, comes first.\nIf we always say, \"I'm going to be home every evening at 5 pm,\" it does not work.\nI am traveling at weekends, and sometimes for weeks, so I am fortunate to have a very strong partner at home who understands that.\nMy wife has lived with me in six countries. Work and life balance is good when you have a family that is understanding.\nWhat is your fundamental business philosophy?\nYou have to have a business with a purpose. Purpose could be humanitarian. It could also be to address shareholder needs or improve technology. I think good companies have a combination of those elements.\nOne \"purpose\" for us is to be a good citizen in all of the communities we serve. If it is all about just growing your business, it will hit a roadblock.\nCV\nDinesh Paliwal\nAge: 60\nNationality: United States\nCareer:\n2017: President and CEO of Harman International Industries Inc\nBefore 2008: President of ABB Group, president for ABB global automation division and board member of Bristol-Myers Squibb and Raytheon\nEducation:\nMaster's degree in engineering from the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT Roorkee).

Upbeat manufacturing data this week showed the strongest output since early 2011. Other firms, exhibiting household electronics and decorative materials, have been more bullish.\nBut quiet halls during the last phase, focused on exports, of the 25,000-exhibitor, biannual three-week Canton Fair, underscore just how hard some of China’s lower margin companies are being squeezed.\nChina’s vast economic transformation has meant rising living standards, but also rising wages, forcing companies to move up the value chain to remain competitive. High-tech industries are springing up to replace labour-intensive sectors such as textiles and apparel.\n“I’ve come to the fair for 10 years. At its peak, people would be queueing up to talk to us,” said a Shenzhen-based exporter selling towels and other goods. “Now there are very few people. There are more exhibitors than foreign buyers.”\nChina’s textile exports fell last year for the first time in six years, slipping 5 percent to $286.8 billion. In January-August of this year, textile and clothing exports are down more than 4.5 percent.\nSome buyers at the sprawling fair complained of poor quality and price rises of more than 10 percent on some goods in the past year. Other prices have doubled in five years, but standards have not kept pace, some noted.\nTurkey and Italy were among countries many buyers are switching to.\n“Maybe they are more expensive, but they have better design,” said Sergey Gerts, an import manager at Sparta Trade House in Russia, referring to markets closer to home. Gerts was visiting the fair for the third time to buy mainly tablecloths and doormats.\nAmong the biggest headaches for textiles and other low-end manufacturers are wages.\nAverage wages in China have grown at an annual compound rate of more than 12 percent - to 45,676 yuan (£5,418) a year in 2013 from 4,538 yuan (£538.29) in 1994, according to the All-China Federation of Trade Unions.\nAuthorities in China have called for a slowdown in wage rises in order for the country to remain competitive.\nSam Ma, at Nantong Lu-Ri Co Ltd, which sells mostly high-end bed sheets, blankets and fleeces, said wages had been rising 5-10 percent a year for several years.\n“In five to 10 years, all the low-end production will go to Pakistan,” he said.\nReporting by Venus Wu; Writing by Anne Marie Roantree; Editing by Clara Ferreira Marques and Ian Geoghegan\nAll quotes delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.

They will also manage eight small CRRC subsidiaries making cargo trains.\nUnder the plan, CRRC Qiqihar will be managing companies including CRRC Shenyang Co and CRRC Shijiazhuang Co. CRRC Yangtze will be responsible for the operation of CRRC Meishan Co and CRRC Taiyuan Co in the future.\nThe two groups will have a combined annual capacity of producing 100,000 rail cargo vehicles. CRRC currently controls about 80 percent of the freight-train market in China in terms of orders.\nThe overhaul came after CRRC saw a slump in freight-car sales, reflecting weaker demand for railway cargo transportation both at home and in overseas markets.\n\"The first task for these two new groups would be cutting overcapacity and overlapping services, putting resources into new products such as heavy load, special railway vehicles and railway vehicle brakes to diversify product categories,\" said Zhao Jian, a professor of rail transportation at Beijing Jiaotong University.\nAffected by lower coal and other commodity prices, the number of cargo trains ordered by China Railway Corp, the State railroad operator, declined from 40,000 units in 2012 to 6,000 units in 2016, according to CRRC data.\nCRRC's sales revenue dropped 5.85 percent year-on-year to 88.72 billion yuan ($13.37 billion) in the first half of 2017, partly affected by its declining freight train business.\nCRRC's rail vehicle-making subsidiaries received few or even no orders last year. Nine of the 10 companies reported net losses in 2016, including CRRC Qiqihar and CRRC Yangtze.\nCRRC was created in June 2015 through the combination of the country's two major train manufacturersï¼CNR and CSR, as the central government pushed for consolidation of State-owned enterprises.\nCRRC Qiqihar and CRRC Yangtze were previously the biggest cargo vehicle subsidiaries of CNR and CSR by production volume. Both companies have annual capacity to produce 15,000 freight trains and repair more than 10,000 cargo cars a year.\nFeng Hao, a rail transportation researcher at the National Development and Reform Commission, China's top economic planner, said even though CRRC is dominating China's market for high-speed trains and regular passenger trains, its freight train business has been challenged by other domestic players for many years.\nEager to seize more market share, other domestic companies such as FIRMACO Baotou Beifang Chuangye Co and Jinxi Axle Co were all actively participating in the open tenders held by China Railway Construction Investment Group for 156,000 units of freight trains last October.\nFIRMACO Baotou Beifang Chuangye Co also gained orders for 750 freight train units from CRC, worth about 280 million yuan, last December.\n"}

Trump brand rip-off, it's not uncommon for Chinese companies to fashion an English name out of Chinese one. For example in the car industry, Chery Auto is derived from \"Qirui\" in Chinese. Geely is \"Jili.\"\nGAC's Yu said he plans to deliver a whole host of Trumpchi goodness to the U.S. when it enters the market in 2019. Trumpchi was the fastest-growing Chinese car brand in China last year and ranked highest among Chinese auto brands in research firm JD Power's 2016 quality survey.\nTrumpchi's progress in China has given it the confidence to believe it can beat the odds and do what no other Chinese car brand has been able to achieve for more than a decade: conquer the U.S.\n\"GAC Motor has dreamed of becoming a world class brand. We have made great achievements domestically within a short period of time,\" Yu told me at a showroom in the company headquarters. \"American drivers are like Chinese drivers. They both like big sizes, big spaces and luxury interior.\"\nFor years, the Chinese have been attempting to build a globally competitive auto industry — and they've struggled.\nChinese car brands have sold in emerging markets, yet exports have recently softened. The U.S. has been an elusive market for them — it's fiercely competitive and Americans have established brand loyalty.\nOn top of that, fairly or unfairly, the \"made-in-China\" label has an image problem. So Trumpchi's efforts will be a gauge to see if Chinese automakers can upgrade themselves and compete on the international stage.\n\"[The U.S.] has the highest standards — which is a good test for us,\" Yu said. \"If we can succeed in the U.S. market, we can succeed anywhere in the world.\"\nThe plan is first to export cars from Trumpchi's factories in China, but Yu said he's considering partnering with a U.S. automaker to produce locally. He sees potential to build his own American factory down the road.\nDespite the anti-China rhetoric and threats of a trade war out of the White House, Yu said Trumpchi is in it for the win.\n\"Even if Trump imposes tariffs on imported cars, this will not diminish our desire or decision to enter the U.S. market,\" he said.\nIs the Trump name a help or a hindrance?\n\"It's hard to say,\" he said while laughing. \"We're still trying to figure that out.\"\nIf he does, Trumpchi and China's auto industry might feel they are finally one step closer to being on top of the world.\n\nPlaying\nShare this video...\nWatch Next...\n"}

{"title": "Chanel Teams Up With Farfetch. Will China's Toplife Be Next?", "author": "Jing Daily", "pub_time": "2018年2月21日", "url": "https://jingdaily.com/chanel-teams-up-with-farfetch-will-chinas-toplife-be-next/", "content": "Chanel has teamed up with Farfetch to develop new digital initiatives, the famously techno-cautious brand announced last week. Chanel has stopped short of selling its items on Farfetch, but the collaboration nevertheless brings the luxury brand much closer to one of Farfetch’s major shareholders, JD.com and its luxury e-commerce platform, Toplife.\nWhile other luxury brands are eagerly rushing into e-commerce, especially in China, Chanel has thus far remained hesitant. Back in November, Bruno Pavlovsky, president of fashion at Chanel, told Chinese media that Chanel would not be selling online or hiring any Chinese KOLs.\n“This [Chanel-Farfetch] deal is about accelerating and enriching the experience of the client before and after their visit to the boutique,” Pavlovsky told The Financial Times last week. Their goal is to court tech-savvy, millennials with a branded app that creates a more personalized in-store experience.\nHowever, with JD.com investing $397 million in Farfetch and JD.com’s CEO Richard Liu becoming one of Farfetch’s largest shareholders last summer, one wonders if Chanel is preparing to relinquish the control and exclusivity that comes from selling only in their own stores to meet the e-commerce expectations of young Chinese consumers. There are certainly signs of an emerging relationship. At last month’s Davos Economic Forum in Switzerland, JD.com held an invitation-only party, and Chanel Heir David Wertheimer was among the 50 guests.\nJing Daily reached out to Chanel’s U.S. corporate office for comment but didn’t immediately receive a response.\nRichard Liu at The World Economic Forum. Photo: ifeng(凤凰网)\nChanel’s History in China\nChanel has long been bullish on China, opening its first makeup store there in 1993, first fine jewelry store in 2007, and first perfume store in 2013. Chanel has also hosted its global Cruise Campaign in three Chinese cities since 2003 – Beijing, Shanghai, and Chengdu.\nLikewise, China has been fond of Chanel since it was first introduced to the country. Chanel is the most-purchased luxury brand among wealthy Chinese, with 41 percent of them having bought a Chanel product in 2014, compared to 32 percent for Dior. Forty-six percent of those surveyed said they hope to buy more Chanel items in the future, according to a CNN Money survey.\nNevertheless, Chanel still has plenty of room to improve their position in the Chinese market. The brand’s sales are reported to have dropped since 2015, forcing the company to knock 20 percent off of its retail prices in 2016. Prices dropped further in China as Chanel sought to bring them into alignment with prices in Europe between mainland China and Europe. We don’t know whether Chanel’s sales have in fact dropped as it is not a publicly listed company, and Chanel doesn’t share the information with outside sources (Jing Daily’s request to verify these sales number was declined by the company).\nOne way for Chanel to turn things around is to make their products available to more consumers in China. Currently, Chanel’s ready-to-wear clothes are sold only in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Chengdu, and its luxury watch and jewelry retail stores are only available in Beijing and Shanghai.\nMeanwhile, JD.com has perhaps the most impressive distribution network in China, capable of delivering items around the country at enviable speeds and low costs, and that’s before the addition of JD.com’s domestic rail freight pilot program. Toplife aims to make the efficiency and convenience of e-commerce more appealing to luxury brands and consumers with a mobile-first, editorial-like design.\nEven if Chanel does decide to embrace China’s booming online luxury market, they may choose not to partner with Toplife but with its biggest competitor, Luxury Pavilion. Jessica Liu, president of Fashion and Luxury at Tmall, told Jing Daily earlier this month that the company “has been in touch with all kinds of luxury fashion brands” to launch exclusive partnerships.\nMarket Trends, Retail\nchanel, china, digital marketing, farfetch, JD.com, luxury lifestyle, luxury pavilion, toplife, wechat\n© 2018 Herlar, LLC.

The brand primarily manufactures candies, sweet cakes and nationally known cereal bar, Sachima (沙琪玛).\nVillela Alex, Nestlé’s marketing officer, believes the new retailer opens a “new era of consumption experience” in China.\n“Taste workshop inherits the traditional confectionery and adheres to the spirit of craftsmanship. The professional baking masters produce fresh pastries and candy like short cakes, handmade biscuits and crispy candies,” he said.\nHowever, the idea of opening an experience retailer is not entirely new, Alex mentioned.\n“Our local organization was inspired by the success of our KitKat initiatives in Japan… there is more into building brands today than simply advertising [them],” he said. “Our current confectionery CMO is in charge of our chocolate business in Japan, and he is making sure to transfer the knowledge and competency to our local market in China.”\nNestlé Japan currently runs a KitKat Chocolatory Ginza store in Tokyo.\nHowever, unlike KitKat which resonates with Japanese consumers because it sounds similar to “lucky” in Japanese, Hsu Fu Chi has “a strong connection with Chinese New Year,” said Alex. “We make traditional confectionery products for that occasion and our goal as a company is to help perpetrate those simple but extremely rich traditions.”\nNestlé said the Hsu Fu Chi store is a “contemporary sense” space using warm-colored wooden material to build the counter, and beige-colored paint for the wall.\nAdditionally, the light display on the ceiling was intentionally designed in a way to mimic the falling crumbs when someone tears a pineapple pie apart, the company said.\nHsu Fu Chi’s brand manager, Li Yanbin (李延斌), previously told confectionery trade body China Candy that young Chinese consumers care more about shopping experience.\n“They want to taste and ‘see’ the flavor at the same time,” he said. “The taste workshop offers handcrafted tea to go along with our baked goods. We are also going to launch more confectionery products and other in-store services in the future to meet various consumer demands.”\nLi said the Hsu Fu Chi store could also help increase the brand’s online sales, as some of the products are available on Tmall (天猫), owned by Alibaba. These items, however, are only delivered to seven cities in Guangdong Province, including Guangzhou, Shenzhen, Foshan, Dongguan, due to their short shelf life.\nNestlé said Hsu Fu Chi would soon open an online taste workshop to service national consumers.\ngoogletag.cmd.push(function () { googletag.display('text-ad1'); });\n“Only by synergizing e-commerce and brick-and-mortar stores can we increase our overall sales as a brand,” Li said.\nHsu Fu Chi has been holding a flat 0.9% share of China’s total chocolate confectionery market over the past three years, according to Euromonitor. Its owner Nestlé’s chocolate brands account for 8.1% share of the market.\nCopyright - Unless otherwise stated all contents of this web site are © 2018 - William Reed Business Media Ltd - All Rights Reserved - Full details for the use of materials on this site can be found in the Terms & Conditions\nRelated topics: Manufacturers, Chocolate, Candy, Emerging Markets, Biscuits, Nestlé, Premium, Natural Colors & Flavors\nFree newsletter Subscribe Sign up to our free newsletter and get the latest news sent direct to your inbox\n"}

It was the first Chinese consumer electronics brand to sponsor the high-profile tournament.\n\"We had achieved successful brand awareness by sponsoring the UEFA European Championship and have also undertaken TV display cooperation projects with FIFA. These helped us win the World Cup sponsorship opportunity,\" said Huang Xiaojian, vice-president of Hisense International Co Ltd.\nHisense have also sponsored the Australian Open tennis tournament, NASCAR racing in the United States, the Red Bull Racing F1 team and Germany's Schalke 04 football club.\nIn recent years, Chinese businesses have started to sponsor global and regional sports events to boost their brand awareness in a bid to expand overseas, rather than relying heavily on traditional sales channels like the Canton Fair, the world's largest comprehensive trade fair.\nEarlier FIFA World Cups and Olympic Games were often dominated by American, European, Japanese and Republic of Korea sponsors. Now Chinese brands are taking the stage.\nMany other consumer electronics makers, like Vivo, Oppo, Huawei and ZTE, have taken similar market strategies.\nIn May, smartphone maker Vivo signed a six-year contract with FIFA to sponsor the 2018 and 2022 World Cup tournaments.\nNi Xudong, senior vice-president of Vivo, said the World Cup will help Vivo boost brand awareness and increase sales.\nHisense's overseas sales soared 30.2 percent year on year in the first three quarters of the year, boosted by the World Cup sponsorship. Growth in the UK and United States markets was even stronger at 41.3 percent and 54.4 percent, respectively.\n\"Sports go beyond national boundaries. Through sponsorships of major sporting events, Hisense quickly won more customers and leapt from a domestic to an international brand,\" said Huang.\nHuang said the growth in overseas markets also came from improvements in product quality and opening of more sales outlets.\nTo better cash in on the World Cup, Hisense opened a new subsidiary in Russia this year, increasing its overseas branches to 13.\n\"After getting to know the products, customers need to have channels to buy them and products should also be reliable,\" said Huang.\nWithout having quality products and sales outlets, sponsorships would be just a waste of money, he said.\nA similar marketing strategy has also helped mobile phone maker ZTE win more customers. ZTE has become the fourth largest smartphone maker in the North American market and fifth largest in the European market.\nChinese firms need to sponsor more sporting events to boost brand awareness to catch up with overseas rivals, said Feng Tao, CEO of Shankai Sports.\n\"We need to sponsor more high-end events to continue to improve our brand awareness and influence,\" said Huang, adding that the firm intends to sponsor the next UEFA European Championship.\n\"If we do not continue our strategy, the marketing will not have a significant effect,\" Huang said.\n"}

Foreign bankers fall out of love with China as ...", "author": "South China Morning Post", "pub_time": "2018年3月4日", "url": "http://www.scmp.com/news/china/economy/article/2135623/too-little-too-late-foreign-bankers-fall-out-love-china-beijing", "content": "\nChina economy\nOverseas investors in the financial sector are weighing their options amid tougher competition, political uncertainty and an unfriendly regulatory environment\nComments:\n\nRoughly two decades ago China made a momentous decision to win the hearts of global capitalists and gain entry to the world’s biggest club of trading nations.\nIt promised to deregulate its financial sector and open its banking market to foreign players.\nSeventeen years down the track, some rule changes have been made but foreign players are still at the margins, battling regulatory foot-dragging and greater domestic competition.\nBanking is a litmus test for the broader Chinese economy. For decades, Beijing took it for granted that overseas investors would be waiting at the gates, keen for a share of a massive market.\nBut that investment tide could be turning as Beijing tightens its grip on economic activity and its piecemeal deregulation raises doubts about its commitment to free trade.\nChina’s financial sector has ballooned from a near standing start at the turn of the century. The country’s state banks, once technically bankrupt, are now the world’s biggest and most profitable lenders.\nProtected from foreign competition and by a closed capital account, the sector’s assets grew by a factor of 12 between 2001 and 2016 to total more than 224 trillion yuan (US$35.3 trillion).\nThe total assets of foreign banks in China also grew – increasing at an average rate of over 20 per cent a year from 92.79 billion yuan in 2006 to 2.68 trillion yuan in 2015.\nBut the foreign banks’ share of the overall holdings more than halved from 2.38 per cent in 2007 to 1.38 per cent in 2015, according to China’s official statistics.\nChina cuts red tape as it looks to even the field for foreign banks\nThe central government has taken some steps to ease the way for overseas players. Just last week, the country’s banking watchdog said foreign lenders only had to apply for one, instead of two, regulatory approvals in opening a new branch. It also said it would scrap administrative “pre-approvals” for banks to offer offshore wealth management services to clients or act as custodians for mutual funds investing in stock markets as long as they notified the regulator.\nIt is the kind of action that foreign lenders have long called for but bank executives say it could be too little, too late.\n“There have been many discussions about the prospects of China’s financial sector among peers in foreign banks recently,” one foreign banking source in Beijing said. “The regulatory easing is a positive move, but many of us are more worried about the prospects of China’s financial sector.”\n\nAnother source involved in deciding China strategy for an American bank said conditions now made it difficult to assess the political risk of expanding in China.\n“Actually we’ve been more keenly looking into opportunities in India since 2012, as we find it harder to discern China’s politics and foresee its policy direction,” the source said.\nForeign bankers are wondering about the potential fallout from Chinese President Xi Jinping’s decision to make curbing financial risks a top priority and the flood of investigations into officials and businesspeople suspected of disrupting market order.\nTen years on, what are foreign banks getting from China’s financial Big Bang?\nBeijing is also moving to eliminate constitutional term limits for the presidency.\nGuo Tianyong, from the Central University of Finance and Economics in Beijing, said foreign investors were probably less interested in China than a decade ago because they knew it was tougher to make easy gains.\n“Foreign banks are struggling in China even with a friendlier regulatory environment because mainland commercial banks have become very competitive,” Guo said.\n“It will take some time for foreign investors to regain an understanding of China’s banking sector and economy in general, as dynamics have changed a lot [in the last 10 years].”\nSome foreign banks were forced to cut back on operations in China during the global financial crisis while others missed the opportunity ride the Chinese wave of expansion and innovation such as mobile banking and internet financing, according to a KPMG report.\nConditions now are clouded by the prospect of a trade war between China and the United States.\nA month after Liu He, Xi’s top economic aide, told the world’s rich and powerful at the Swiss ski resort of Davos that China would open its domestic markets wider and that this year’s reform measures could “exceed the international community’s expectations”, he was in Washington last week on an urgent mission to defuse trade tensions. Little appears to have come out of the trip except for an agreement to keep talking.\nBrock Silvers, managing director of Kaiyuan Capital, a Shanghai-based investment advisory firm, said a cocktail of factors, including uncertain China-US ties, concerns about intrusive state intervention and perceived political risks, would deter foreign investors from China.\nThere was no sign of a convertible yuan or an end to capital account controls, major concerns for financial investors, he said.\n“[And] China’s political risk, or at least Western perception of it, seems to be increasing,” Silvers said.\nYou are signed up.

The majority of Chinese respondents said they were more likely to make future investments in the UK because of Brexit.\nA total of 360 companies from China, Germany, France, the UK, and the United States participated in the poll, which was commissioned by Brussels-based investment trade association Invest Europe.\nMore than half, or 58 percent, of the 81 Chinese companies that shared their opinions said they were more likely to invest in the UK during the next five years. The participating Chinese companies do business in a range of sectors and have either made the decision to invest internationally in the last 12 months, or have previously considered investing in a European company.\nMichael Collins, chief executive of Invest Europe, said the results may reflect the potential for new trade relations between the UK and other international markets, including China.\nThe UK is in the process of negotiating its departure from the EU, the world's largest trading bloc, following a referendum held last year.\n\"One explanation is that companies might see a way in which, post-Brexit, the UK might become even more open to foreign direct investment than it has been in the past,\" Collins said.\nHe noted that some international companies may be banking on continued favorable pricing of sterling-denominated assets, following a drop in the value of the pound following the referendum.\n\"The reduction that's happened already has made the UK more attractive and you might not think sterling will necessarily recover significantly, or you might see a scenario where sterling could decline further,\" Collins said.\nPolitical and economic uncertainty around the Brexit issue has left some European investors wary.\nIn the poll, 55 percent of investors from Germany and 52 percent of investors based in France said they were less likely to invest in the UK because of its decision to leave the EU. Fifty two percent of respondents from the United States said Brexit would not change their investment plans in relation to the UK.\n\"The closer you are to the debate, I suppose it's more likely that you are following the twists and turns of Brexit on a day-today basis, so it probably looms rather larger in your thinking,\" Collins said. \"There is a degree of integration between the UK and French and German economies precisely because of EU membership.\"\n"}

Following the yuan's entry in the basket, the exchange rate between the yuan and dollar experienced strong fluctuations.\nIt was a tough situation for Zhang, who had to find a proper plan to lower the risks and costs as much as possible.\nWith the support of the Guangzhou branch of the People's Bank of China (PBOC), the central bank, Zhang soon managed to sign deals with two other banks, which granted about 8 billion yuan ($1.2 billion) of cross-border loans to the M&A project.\n\"As the renminbi was going global, we wanted to prepare for the yuan's international settlement in the future, which is why we applied for the loans in renminbi,\" Zhang said.\nAfter a few adjustments, Apexmic formed a consortium worth $2.68 billion. In May this year, the M&A was completed, and Apexmic was renamed Ninestar, with annual sales revenue expected to exceed 3 billion yuan.\n\"The project proved that financing in renminbi is an effective channel,\" Zhang said. \"It provides a stable mechanism for healthy economic activities.\"\nSunday marks the first anniversary of the yuan officially joining the elite reserve currency basket. The inclusion makes the yuan one of the five reserve currencies fully endorsed by the 189-member organization, joining the US dollar, the euro, the Japanese yen and the British pound.\nThe PBOC called the yuan's SDR inclusion \"a milestone in the internationalization of the yuan\" and \"recognition of China's progress in economic development as well as financial reforms and opening up.\"\nIn the past year, despite increasing fluctuations, the yuan has gained significant recognition.\n\"The market has realized that the two-way volatility in renminbi trading is significant, and the interest rate will be more flexible in the future,\" said an employee at a Guangzhou branch of SPD Bank.\nShe said that both companies and individuals took time to get used to the situation, and that after the initial phase, the market had adapted to the volatility.\nAccording to the PBOC Guangzhou branch, Guangdong had 55,614 companies and 3,280 bank outlets handling settlements in renminbi by the end of August. The province, which has the biggest economic aggregate in China, has conducted renminbi settlement with 213 countries and regions.\nAccording to secure financial messaging service provider SWIFT, by the end of June more than 1,900 financial institutions were using the yuan for settlement, and about 56 foreign central banks or monetary authorities hold capital in renminbi in China and have included it in their foreign currency reserves.\n\"China has strengthened the transparency of its exchange rate policies after joining the SDR, and the yuan is getting more and more attention in the international financial market,\" said Guan Tongwei, a professor at Guangdong University of Finance.\n\"China is promoting the free floating of the renminbi based on its economic situation, market expectations and the price indexes of various countries,\" Guan said. \"The renminbi will continue its mission to serve people all over the world.\"\n"}

The money had been spent on mobile games by her triplet sons, who took her phone to pay for the games and deleted the payment notification texts afterwards.\nIn April, a 17-year-old gamer in south China's Guangzhou was diagnosed with cerebral infarction, after playing a popular online game called King of Glory for 40 hours nonstop.\nThese are just two of the many cases related to mobile games that have been buzzing on the Internet in China over the past few months.\nAccording to a report released by China Internet Network Information Center in January, 170 million under-18s are online in China, while 43.7 percent of them spend over an hour on tablets and smartphones each day.\nIn 2016, the total revenue of the games industry reached 165 billion yuan, increasing by 17.7 percent from 2015. Despite this contribution to the economy, the way games are paid for still draws plenty of public criticism.\nWhat's worse, parents often face big problems when they try to get their money back from the game companies. For Han Ying, a lawyer who has been keeping an eye on the issue, proof is the biggest obstacle for parents.\nThe \"proof\" that parents have to show often includes bills, purchase history, and even video clips of children playing the games, which is to prove that it is them who paid the money.\n\"But it's almost impossible to decide whether it was the children's behavior, merely by observing online behavior,\" she admitted.\nStronger action has already been taken. In January, the State Council, China's cabinet released a set of rules to protect under-18s on the Internet, including limiting playing time, as well as demanding an identity registration and an anti-doping system in games.\nIn May, the Ministry of Culture issued a statement to strengthen the identity registration system in online games to control payments made by children, as according to the Civil Law, those under 10 have no capacity for civil conduct, while for those aged between 10 and 18, it is limited.\nHowever, He Jihua, deputy to the National People's Congress, found in his investigations that a lot of mobile games had a rather loose identity registration system, and some even teach juvenile players how to avoid the system.\n\"The rules and censoring of mobile games should be stricter and more comprehensive,\" he said, suggesting methods such as face recognition in the login process.\n\"Preventing children becoming addicting to online games is a complex project,\" said Deng Lili, a researcher on animations and games at Peking University. \"It requires the joint efforts of families, schools and business.\"\nZhu Wei, associate professor at China University of Political Science and Law, echoed Deng's views. \"Only with the cooperation of supervisors, the game companies and society, can supervision truly make a difference.\"\nOthers specifically call for a bigger role for parents.\n\"It makes no sense for parents to blame the games for the children's addiction,\" said \"Xielaoban\" on the Twitter-like Weibo. \"They have to teach their children not to get addicted.\"\nChina Focus: Xi inspects PLA garrison in Hong Kong\nXi calls on HK youths to serve HK, country\nEvening gala held to celebrate 20th anniv. of HK's return to motherland\nCentral China's Juzizhou Islet resort closed due to flood\nChina, Kyrgyzstan hold anti-terror drill in Xinjiang\nIn pics: woodblock movable type printing in C China\nMuslims celebrate Eid al-Fitr worldwide\nPlane Pull fundraising campaign held in Vancouver, Canada\n"}

Picture taken April 12, 2018. Credit: Li Gang/Xinhua via Reuters\n\nAfter addressing the Boao Forum, the Asian Davos, and delivering the message of how China sought to promote inclusive and open economies, Xi Jinping shed his suit and donned combat fatigues to board a destroyer in the South China on Thursday to participate in a huge naval review. There was a clear message in his act – China would deal with the world from a position of strength, in both economic and military fields, and that it was prepared for any eventuality.\nFor the biggest maritime parade held in China since 1949, the People’s Liberation Army Navy (PLAN) deployed 48 warships, 76 aircraft and 10,000 sailors and marines. The demonstration, in its own way, marks the coming of age of China as a maritime power.\nThe parade was a culmination of a series of live fire exercises involving the aircraft carrier Liaoning in the vicinity of Hainan island, near the venue of the Boao Forum. The Chinese authorities had said that these were routine annual events to enhance training and professional skills. But now the Chinese say that they will hold live fire drills in the Taiwan Straits next week, in a message to Taipei. These will be the first naval manoeuvres off Taiwan since 2015.\nThe Chinese action comes in response to a stepped-up US presence in the region. In the past two months, two powerful US carrier groups have operated in the region. Britain and France have also declared that they will send naval vessels to the region to contest China’s extravagant claims in the region.\nAccording to Global Times, “all combat systems of the PLA Navy and 10 air echelons joined the parade.” China’s sole aircraft carrier Liaoning was the centrepiece of the exercise, where on board the destroyer Changsha, Xi watched the take-off of the J-15 aircraft from its deck. Besides this, the parade featured 052C destroyers, Type 071 amphibious transport dock and Type 093 submarines.\nHolding the parade in the South China Sea, off Hainan island, is significant for a variety of reasons. First, it is a region which is vital for the PLAN because it hosts its principal submarine base, where its second strike deterrent is based. Second, it is an area which is disputed by the neighbouring countries and where China lost an arbitration case in 2015, bringing into question its claim over the territorial waters of the area. China has reclaimed what an arbitration court said were several low-tide elevation features and built military facilities on them.\nThird, the US has been flexing its muscles in the region recently and on April 10, it sent the USS Theodore Roosevelt aircraft carrier group into the region as a show of strength. Earlier, in February, the USS Carl Vinson group had patrolled the disputed region.\nFour, it is proximate to Taiwan, a region where tension has been building up between the US and China with the former’s outreach, which includes the passage of a law that encourages high-level visits to the island and the decision to license a submarine manufacturing project there.\nThough US President Donald Trump undercut the economic leg of the US response to China in the region by walking out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, his administration has been more active in pushing military patrols in the region as compared to the Barack Obama administration. US manoeuvres are taking place more frequently and are, no doubt, encouraging China to step up its own military activity.\nIn January, US secretary of defence Jim Mattis visited Vietnam and in early March, the Carl Vinson docked in Da Nang port. Vietnam has been the most outspoken critic of China’s claims, especially since it has lost the Paracel Islands to the Chinese, who have now been encroaching on the Spratly group and challenging Vietnam in its own EEZ.\nAt one level, the naval parade was a demonstration of the success of military reforms undertaken by the PLA. Over the past five years, the Chinese have changed the mission of the PLAN from being involved in coastal defence to plans relating to the high seas. The 2015 China Military Strategy document had declared that “China is a major maritime as well as a land country”. Given the assemblage of vessels, the PLAN also signalled that it would now operate as a mission-oriented fleet rather than being separated into its eastern, northern and southern orientation.\nNavy personnel of Chinese People’s Liberation Army (PLA) Navy take part in a military display in the South China Sea April 12, 2018. Credit: Reuters/Stringer\nOf all of Xi’s reform efforts, the most successful have been those relating to the PLA. In 2015-2016, the force was reduced in numbers and restructured into geographic theatre commands. The higher command system constituting of the Central Military Commission was flattened and a new system, involving 15 departments, institutions and commissions, created, called the “CMC Chairman Responsibility System”. Xi, of course, is the chairman of the CMC. Later, he also assumed the designation of the head of the “Joint Operations Command Centre”.\nThe Southern Theatre Command of the PLA which was earlier the Guangzhou Military Region is currently headed by a PLAN officer, Vice Admiral Yuan Yubai, the first non-army officer to head a regional command.\nThe PLA has declared that it aims to fight and win “informationised local wars”, though an increasing number of analysts say that the term should be “intelligentised local wars”, with reference to the role of integrated Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (C4IASR) systems.\nThe exercise featuring the Liaoning, an unfinished vessel formerly called Varyag that China bought from Ukraine, only marks the beginning of the PLAN as an aircraft carrier-operating naval power seeking to rival the US. The 60,000-tonne vessel is seen as a training ship which will give way to two new carriers that the Chinese are building in Shanghai and Dalian. These will be bigger and more capable ships. China, according to reports, plans to have four aircraft carrier groups by 2030.\nManoj Joshi is a distinguished fellow, Observer Research Foundation, New Delhi.\n"}

To get it delivered daily to your in-box, sign up here.\nThe blockchain and cryptocurrencies might be a big thing. Maybe. Some day. If a lot of things go right.\nDon’t take my skeptical word for it, though. That’s more or less the conclusion of one of the field’s true believers, Adam Ludwin, the articulate founder of technology company Chain. (Blockchain.com wasn’t available, he says.) I interviewed Ludwin Tuesday night in San Francisco at a well-attended walk-up dinner for July’s Brainstorm Tech conference.\nIf the nascent field were populated exclusively by people like Ludwin there’d be far less hype. But that’s not how these things work. He freely admits there is ample noise but also a discernible signal. A decentralized system for managing software applications and for trading money free of government control (read: censorship) has much promise. The problem is that it’s more promise than current value, even less so than was evident in the fledgling “Internet” a generation ago. (Read Jonathan Vanian’s write-up here, where you also can watch the video, as well as Andrew Nusca’s review in today’s CEO Daily.)\nLudwin’s thesis is that we’d be a whole lot less hot and bothered about the blockchain, a word he thinks has lost most of its meaning amidst the hoo-hah, if it didn’t involve money. Because it does it’s easy to get people’s attention—and mindless investment dollars.\nIncidentally, Ludwin is a sought-after speaker on this topic because last October he wrote a long memo taking to task cryptocurrency troglodyte Jamie Dimon. Ludwin says Dimon graciously reached out to meet, which the two did in Davos in January. And Ludwin lavished praise on crypto projects JPMorgan Chase has pursued since.\nThat’s near proof something will come of this. Maybe. Some day. If a lot of things go right.\nCrypto law enforcer. Did somebody mention bitcoin? New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman is looking into 13 digital currency exchanges, including big names Coinbase and Bitfinex, seeking information about their policies on privacy, fraud, and money laundering, among other matters. The Gemini Exchange, founded by Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, also got a request. “We look forward to cooperating with and submitting our responses to the questionnaire that has been circulated,” Gemini CEO Tyler Winklevoss tells the New York Post.\nTax it to me later. Sticking with the legal world, the Supreme Court heard arguments on Tuesday in the case of South Dakota v. Wayfair Inc., which challenges the landmark 1992 ruling Quill Corp. v. North Dakota holding that online retailers don’t have to collect sales taxes for states where they are not physically present. While Justice Anthony Kennedy signaled his desire to overturn Quill a few years ago, it didn’t seem like many of his colleagues were on board on Tuesday. Justice Sonia Sotomayor asked a series of withering questions challenging South Dakota Attorney General Marty Jackley. “I’m concerned about the many unanswered questions that overturning precedents will create a massive amount of lawsuits about,” Sotomayor noted.\nTax it to me later, part two. And speaking of taxes, the Internal Revenue Service’s online portal for paying taxes crashed on Tuesday, the last day to make an on-time payment for 2017 income taxes. So the IRS extended the filing deadline until today.\nNIMFY: Not in my front yard. San Francisco is cracking down on the wave of scooter startups (LimeBike, Bird, and Spin) that have blanketed the city’s sidewalks with a scourge of electric-powered bikes. The Board of Supervisors on Tuesday unanimously passed a rule requiring a permit to park a scooter on the sidewalk. “I’m quite amazed at the brouhaha,” Supervisor Aaron Peskin said at the meeting.\nIf you can’t beat ’em, join ’em. With new privacy regulation under discussion in Congress, Facebook is looking for potential allies and reaching out to conservative groups, Politico reports. Given “the rapidly changing discussions here in Washington, there’s an increased chance Washington will rush to regulate, with privacy concerns at the top of the radar,” Facebook public policy manager Lori Moylan wrote in an email to the groups that was obtained by Politico.\nYou’re holding it wrong. IBM is finally growing again, but not the right way, at least in Wall Street’s eyes. The recovering tech giant posted first quarter revenue of $19.1 billion, up 5% from last year and better than analysts expected. But the growth of sales in IBM’s so-called strategic imperatives—which includes social, mobile, analytics and cloud services—slowed to 15% from 17% in the prior quarter. IBM shares were down 5% in premarket trading on Wednesday.\nHasty retreat. Chinese telecom giant Huawei is scaling back its decade-long effort to crack the U.S. market, the New York Times reported. Layoffs hit the company’s lobbying office in Washington, D.C., where the climate has turned decidedly negative on the Chinese tech industry.\nDo you still love going to see a movie on a big screen at the movie theater? Startup MoviePass is fueling a bit of renaissance in cinema going by effectively subsidizing ticket buying. Brent Lang at Variety takes a deep dive into the controversial business model. Surprisingly or not, it seems some theater owners are not amused:\nMichael Barstow, who runs business development and sales analytics for Main Street Theatres, an eight-location chain based out of Nebraska, has been partnering with MoviePass since December. He cuts the service in on ticket sales in exchange for having the company promote Main Street on its app and drive people to its cinemas. “Our customers were demanding MoviePass, and we were listening to them,” says Barstow. “We’re a small family-run business, and we compete with the titans of the industry, with your Regals and your AMCs, so we’re always looking for a competitive advantage.”\nOthers feel MoviePass’ strategy isn’t well thought out.\n“It’s a chain-saw approach when a surgical scalpel is needed,” says Jeff Logan, president and CEO of Logan Luxury Theatres, a South Dakota-based chain with three locations.\nLogan hasn’t had any talks with MoviePass and says he’s not interested in working with the company. He thinks it’s lunacy to cut prices on moviegoing in such a comprehensive manner.\nFacebook Is Giving You New Privacy Options, But It’s Clear What It Wants You to Choose By David Meyer\nHow to Watch Beyonce’s Record-Breaking Coachella Performance By Kirsten Korosec\nU.S. Homeland Security Chief on Potential Russian Voting Hacking By Jonathan Vanian\nNetflix Close to Catching Up With Disney in Stock Market Value After Banner First Quarter By Aaron Pressman\nSnapchat’s Newest Feature Lets You Build Your Own Face Filter By Kristin Korosec\nApple’s iPhone X Took 35% of Smartphone Profits in the Fourth Quarter By Don Reisinger\nResy Says It Has a New Plan to Turn Tables Better and Help Diners Nab Hard-to-Get Reservations By Rachel King\nKeeping up with our sporadic series of updates on the world’s largest airplane and the wacky billionaire who’s building it, Paul Allen’s Stratolaunch said it will try the first test flight of its 385-foot-wingspan craft this summer.

The type of games exported was also quite limited, with action role-playing games making up the majority.\nBut now, online strategy, cards, music and dance games developed by Chinese companies also are reaping good results in other overseas markets, the report said.\nKing of Avalon, a strategy game produced by Shanghai 37 Interactive Entertainment, earned more than 1 billion yuan ($148 million) globally in the past six months.\nAction role-playing games, at which Chinese companies excel, are no longer popular just in Chinese communities. Legacy of Discord, developed by Shanghai-based Yoozoo Games, has also performed quite well in Europe, the United States and the Middle East, with its global monthly revenue reaching $41 million. Revenge of Sultans â the work of 2-year-old gaming company Onemt â saw its monthly revenue reach over 10 million yuan in the Middle East.\nZheng Nan, research director for the report, said that it is prime time for Chinese game companies taking part in global competition.\n\"With the central government's stress on internet development and the Belt and Road Initiative, Chinese game companies will benefit from policies and gain more means to participate in overseas competition,\" he said.\nAmong the 10 most profitable gaming companies globally last year, two are from China, including Shenzhen-based Tencent and Guangzhou-based NetEase, according to mobile market monitor Newzoo.\nBeijing-based Perfect World is one of the first Chinese game companies to mainly target overseas markets. It began setting up its overseas studios in major Western markets such as the United States and France about nine years ago to integrate its overseas resources and, more importantly, to communicate Chinese culture, said Xiao Hong, chief executive officer of Perfect World.\n\"Over the years, we have seen that the business model for exporting Chinese games is also applicable for exporting the Chinese culture,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<!-- <![CDATA[{}</p><p>#U102763695725DKF{</p><p> font-size: 30;</p><p> letter-spacing: 0;</p><p> line-height: 33;</p><p>}</p><p>#U102763695725cQG{</p><p> letter-spacing: -60;</p><p>}</p><p>#U102763695725KyH{</p><p> letter-spacing: -35;</p><p>}</p><p>#U102763695725STE{</p><p> letter-spacing: -35;</p><p>}</p><p>#U102763695725rOF{</p><p> letter-spacing: -20;</p><p>}</p><p>#U102763695725cME{</p><p> letter-spacing: -52;</p><p>}</p><p>#U102763695725fgC{</p><p> letter-spacing: -38;</p><p>}</p><p>#U102764110124MmB{</p><p> display: none;</p><p>}</p><p>#U102764110124jxB{</p><p> letter-spacing: -28;</p><p>}</p><p>#U1027641101241e{</p><p> letter-spacing: -32;</p><p>}]]> -->\n"}

[Yang Dong/for China Daily]\nShares of companies related to the new energy car industry surged on Monday, hot on the heels of the news that China is working on a timetable to ban the production and sale of fossil fuel cars.\nXin Guobin, vice-minister of industry and information technology, told the International Forum on Chinese Automotive Industry Development in Tianjin that the ministry will draw up a timetable to ban the production and sale of fossil fuel cars.\n\"It will profoundly drive the development environment and momentum of China's auto industry,\" he said, and pointed out that the industry should pay attention to the issues of excessive production and innovation of core technology.\nFollowing his speech, the EV sector on Monday climbed 4.17 percent in the A-share market, while the Shanghai Securities Composite Index saw a slight increase of 0.33 percent.\nBYD, China's largest electric-vehicle maker, gained over 7 percent in both markets in Shanghai and Shenzhen, while Shanghai-listed Guangzhou Automobile Group Co Ltd, another Chinese automaker manufacturing new energy cars, was also boosted by 4.67 percent at closing.\nBYD on Monday won the bidding of 822 electric bus procurement plan by a Shenzhen-based bus operator, shortly after the announcement earlier this month that it will provide above 400 e-vehicles to another local public transportation company.\nIn addition, other companies related to the industry, such as raw materials, battery and charging station makers, all went up. For instance, Shenzhen Desay Battery Technology rallied 3.57 percent while Sunwoda Electronic ended up 5.44 percent.\nWang Liusheng, chief analyst of automobile industry at CSM Securities, said the plan reflects the government's long-term strategic support for the industry, but it still needs a long term to actually carry it out.\nHe estimated the deadline will be after 2030 because the size of automobiles in China is large and the penetration rate of EV cars now is lowï¼only about 1.86 percent last year.\nAs the largest producer and market for new energy vehicles, China sold more than 520,000 EV cars in 2016 while the total sales volume of automobiles were 28 million.\nThe deadline will be sometime when the penetration rate grows to above 30 percent, he added.\nChen Zikun, an analyst at GF Securities, expects the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology to set a percentage in a period of time for fossil fuel cars to exit gradually and it won't be a mandatory requirement.\nIn short-term, Chen said the real factor shaping sales of EV cars in the next two years is still government financial subsidies, which the brokerage firm speculates won't decrease in 2018.\n"}

Clothes and reading-glasses connected to the internet.\nSuch things may be science fiction today but they will be scientific fact by 2025 as the world enters an era of advanced robotics, artificial intelligence and gene editing, according to executives surveyed by the World Economic Forum (WEF).\nNearly half of those questioned also expect an artificial intelligence machine to be sitting on a corporate board of directors within the next decade.\n\nWelcome to the next industrial revolution.\nAfter steam, mass production and information technology, the so-called “fourth industrial revolution” will bring ever faster cycles of innovation, posing huge challenges to companies, workers, governments and societies alike.\nThe promise is cheaper goods and services, driving a new wave of economic growth. The threat is mass unemployment and a further breakdown of already strained trust between corporations and populations.\n\n“There is an economic surplus that is going to be created as a result of this fourth industrial revolution,” Satya Nadella, chief executive of Microsoft, told the WEF’s annual meeting in Davos on Wednesday.\n“The question is how evenly will it be spread between countries, between people in different economic strata and also different parts of the economy.”\nRobots are already on the march, moving from factories into homes, hospitals, shops, restaurants and even war zones, while advances in areas like artificial neural networks are starting to blur the barriers between man and machine.\n\nOne of the most in-demand participants in Davos this year is not a central banker, CEO or politician but a prize-winning South Korean robot called HUBO, which is strutting its stuff amid a crowd of smartphone-clicking delegates.\nBut there are deep worries, as well as awe, at what technology can do.\nA new report from UBS released in Davos predicts that extreme levels of automation and connectivity will worsen already deepening inequalities by widening the wealth gap between developed and developing economies.\n\n“The fourth industrial revolution has potentially inverted the competitive advantage that emerging markets have had in the form of low-cost labour,” said Lutfey Siddiqi, global head of emerging markets for FX, rates and credit at UBS.\n“It is likely, I would think, that it will exacerbate inequality if policy measures are not taken.”\nAn analysis of major economies by the Swiss bank concludes that Switzerland is the country best-placed to adapt to the new robot world, while Argentina ranks bottom.\nThere will be winners and losers among companies, too, as new players move into established industries with disruptive new technologies.\n\nThat is something uppermost in the minds of Davos attendees such as General Motors CEO Mary Barra, who is confronting the threat of driverless cars - another science fiction that has become science fact - or bank boss Jamie Dimon at JPMorgan Chase , facing competition from digital “fintech” start-ups.\nSuch innovations, coupled with the rise of robots in both the manufacturing and service sectors, could automate vast numbers of jobs. Oxford University researchers predicted in 2013, for example, that 47 per cent of US jobs were at risk.\n\nSuch fears about technology destroying jobs are not new. The economist John Maynard Keynes famously cried wolf in 1931, by issuing a warning of widespread “technological unemployment”.\nThe question is whether this time will be different, given the speed to change and the fact that machines now offer brain as well as brawn, threatening professions previously seen as immune, such as entry-level journalism or routine financial analysis.\nPessimists fear this will hollow out middle-income, middle-class jobs on an unprecedented scale, with the WEF itself predicting that more than 5 million jobs could be lost in 15 major economies by 2020.\n\nBut ManpowerGroup CEO Jonas Prising is more upbeat for the long term.\n“If history is any indicator, we’ll have more jobs being created in the end than are going to be destroyed,” he said.\nHowever, beyond the Davos talking-shop there are doubts about how well business leaders will actually plan for the future.\n“When you have these very big levels of disruptive change you need some pretty serious thinking and action,” said Ian Goldin, professor of globalisation and development at Oxford University.\n“But the CEO who really looks years ahead and looks at broader social issues is rare, even in Davos.”\nYou are signed up.

{"title": "Uber Creator Invents New Cryptocurrency—And Wants Your Help ...", "author": "Fortune", "pub_time": "2018年3月1日", "url": "http://fortune.com/2018/03/01/bitcoin-uber-cryptocurrency-eco-garrett-camp/", "content": "In November, Garrett Camp had just returned from his first trip to Africa—an “eye-opening” experience, he said—when he informed the world that he would donate half his riches to charity.\nWhat Uber’s cofounder and chairman didn’t mention was that he intended to do more than just give away money. Indeed, he had resolved to invent his own.\nOver the past five months, Camp has been sketching out plans for a brand new cryptocurrency that aims to fix technical and other challenges plaguing existing projects, such as Bitcoin and Ethereum. His hope, he told Fortune, is to resuscitate virtual currency’s original promise: an instant, affordable, and borderless means of payment for the masses.\nAlmost a year ago in May, Camp bought his first Bitcoin along with 10 Ether, Ethereum’s native token, on Coinbase, a popular online exchange in the U.S. But as he looked to invest further in the ballooning field of digital tokens and alternative cryptocurrencies, he was let down.\n“The more research I did, the more I was not really wanting to buy a large amount of any one of them,” Camp told Fortune. “I realized it might be better to release a new project from a different philosophical standpoint with cooperation from a lot of universities, scientists, and research institutes—like the Internet,” he said, in terms of its path to development.\nCamp has christened his rival project “Eco,” a name he settled on because it is short, easy to pronounce in many languages, and evokes concepts like “ecosystem,” “economics,” and “ecommerce.”\nCamp is one of a number of entrepreneurs who have thrown their hats into the cryptocurrency ring in recent months. Pavel Durav, the CEO and founder of chat app Telegram, has been building buzz around a billion-dollar “initial coin offering.” Other businesses like Overstock, Kodak, and chat app Kik have either held or intend to hold ICOs. Even Mark Zuckerburg, Facebook’s CEO, said that he planned to focus this year on fixing Facebook, a goal that included exploring “encryption and cryptocurrency.”\n“Eco seeks to create the most usable digital currency platform to date, offering users an alternative to bitcoin, gold and fiat currency at Eco.com,” says Eco’s white paper, a draft of which Fortune reviewed. “New payment systems are needed which are not controlled by a central institution, and provide better user experiences using mobile devices.”\nA few differentiators set the Eco protocol apart from the tech underlying other cryptocurrencies, like Bitcoin. First off, Eco’s blockchain, or shared ledger system, is designed to run on “verified nodes,” rather than on the machines of an anonymous network of volunteers.\nWhat the system loses in resilience and security, it gains in efficiency and coordinated governance. The trade-off strikes “more of a middle ground,” as Camp puts it, between decentralization (like Bitcoin) and centralization (Visa).\nCamp says he’s initially seeking to partner with the top 5% universities and research institutes around the world, which number in the couple thousands, to run these early nodes.\nAnother difference from Bitcoin is Eco’s incentive structure. Instead of having cryptocurrency “miners” compete against one another for the entire crypto-lottery prize, in his proposed system, every time an Eco node confirms a block of financial transactions, the cryptocurrency reward gets dispensed across the network to all nodes and users.\nIn this scenario, the people running nodes—also known as token generators—are incentivized to do just the bare minimum to confirm the next block, so that everyone makes money. This economic switch means that miners won’t be motivated to throw as much computing resources at these problems, thereby reducing the energy consumed.\nLazy nodes can be booted from the network by a quorum of peers, and new ones can join through a similar, reverse process, Camp said.\nAnother factor is distribution. Camp doesn’t want a small group of speculators to hoard Eco tokens. The more people who get their hands on it, the better, in his view.\nIn fact, Camp is giving away free money to prime the pump.

{"title": "Uber Creator Invents New Cryptocurrency—And Wants Your Help ...", "author": "Fortune", "pub_time": "2018年3月1日", "url": "http://fortune.com/2018/03/01/bitcoin-uber-cryptocurrency-eco-garrett-camp/", "content": "In November, Garrett Camp had just returned from his first trip to Africa—an “eye-opening” experience, he said—when he informed the world that he would donate half his riches to charity.\nWhat Uber’s cofounder and chairman didn’t mention was that he intended to do more than just give away money. Indeed, he had resolved to invent his own.\nOver the past five months, Camp has been sketching out plans for a brand new cryptocurrency that aims to fix technical and other challenges plaguing existing projects, such as Bitcoin and Ethereum. His hope, he told Fortune, is to resuscitate virtual currency’s original promise: an instant, affordable, and borderless means of payment for the masses.\nAlmost a year ago in May, Camp bought his first Bitcoin along with 10 Ether, Ethereum’s native token, on Coinbase, a popular online exchange in the U.S. But as he looked to invest further in the ballooning field of digital tokens and alternative cryptocurrencies, he was let down.\n“The more research I did, the more I was not really wanting to buy a large amount of any one of them,” Camp told Fortune. “I realized it might be better to release a new project from a different philosophical standpoint with cooperation from a lot of universities, scientists, and research institutes—like the Internet,” he said, in terms of its path to development.\nCamp has christened his rival project “Eco,” a name he settled on because it is short, easy to pronounce in many languages, and evokes concepts like “ecosystem,” “economics,” and “ecommerce.”\nCamp is one of a number of entrepreneurs who have thrown their hats into the cryptocurrency ring in recent months. Pavel Durav, the CEO and founder of chat app Telegram, has been building buzz around a billion-dollar “initial coin offering.” Other businesses like Overstock, Kodak, and chat app Kik have either held or intend to hold ICOs. Even Mark Zuckerburg, Facebook’s CEO, said that he planned to focus this year on fixing Facebook, a goal that included exploring “encryption and cryptocurrency.”\n“Eco seeks to create the most usable digital currency platform to date, offering users an alternative to bitcoin, gold and fiat currency at Eco.com,” says Eco’s white paper, a draft of which Fortune reviewed. “New payment systems are needed which are not controlled by a central institution, and provide better user experiences using mobile devices.”\nA few differentiators set the Eco protocol apart from the tech underlying other cryptocurrencies, like Bitcoin. First off, Eco’s blockchain, or shared ledger system, is designed to run on “verified nodes,” rather than on the machines of an anonymous network of volunteers.\nWhat the system loses in resilience and security, it gains in efficiency and coordinated governance. The trade-off strikes “more of a middle ground,” as Camp puts it, between decentralization (like Bitcoin) and centralization (Visa).\nCamp says he’s initially seeking to partner with the top 5% universities and research institutes around the world, which number in the couple thousands, to run these early nodes.\nAnother difference from Bitcoin is Eco’s incentive structure. Instead of having cryptocurrency “miners” compete against one another for the entire crypto-lottery prize, in his proposed system, every time an Eco node confirms a block of financial transactions, the cryptocurrency reward gets dispensed across the network to all nodes and users.\nIn this scenario, the people running nodes—also known as token generators—are incentivized to do just the bare minimum to confirm the next block, so that everyone makes money. This economic switch means that miners won’t be motivated to throw as much computing resources at these problems, thereby reducing the energy consumed.\nLazy nodes can be booted from the network by a quorum of peers, and new ones can join through a similar, reverse process, Camp said.\nAnother factor is distribution. Camp doesn’t want a small group of speculators to hoard Eco tokens. The more people who get their hands on it, the better, in his view.\nIn fact, Camp is giving away free money to prime the pump. Out of a total of 1 trillion tokens to be generated over several years, the project plans to disseminate half the supply to the first 1 billion users. Camp plans to set aside a fifth of the tokens for verified nodes (in this case, university partners and researchers), a tenth for the Eco Foundation, to pay operational expenses and fund research grants, another tenth for advisors and active contributors, and a final tenth for “strategic partners worldwide.”\nTo spearhead the Eco effort, Camp said he is creating a new non-profit organization, the Eco Foundation, that he plans to fund with $10 million from himself and a small number of partners affiliated with Expa, his 4-year-old startup accelerator.

The investment environment keeps improving and we have full confidence in the following market exploration.\"\nChina (Shanghai) Pilot Free Trade Zone (FTZ), where SAIC-GM is located, was launched in 2013 to test new policies including negative list management for foreign investment, preferential trade and financial policies, and opening up of more industries to foreign investors.\nAs of September, 49,000 new companies had been registered in the FTZ. Of these, about 8,940 foreign-funded enterprises had been launched, attracting investment worth more than $17 billion.\nChina has ranked among the world's top three in terms of foreign investment utilization for five years and its engagement in global economic governance is deepening.\nIn the first nine months of 2017, foreign investment utilization in China hit more than 618 billion yuan ($93 billion), up 1.6 percent year-on-year, according to the Ministry of Commerce.\nMore than 23,500 foreign-funded enterprises were established in the first nine months, 10.6 percent more than in the same period of 2016, the ministry said.\nHarley Seyedin, president of the American Chamber of Commerce in South China, which represents more than 2,300 multinational companies doing business in China, said that he believes China will become more and more open.\nXi's report draws \"a very clear map and direction for foreign investors going forward\" as China's economy has been transitioning from a phase of rapid growth to a stage of high-quality development, said Seyedin.\nBetween 1978 and 2013, the annual growth of the Chinese economy averaged close to 10 percent and between 2003 and 2007, more than 11.5 percent.\nGDP growth slowed to 7.3 percent in 2014, 6.9 percent in 2015 and 6.7 percent in 2016 as the world's second largest economy is striving to shift gears to slower speed but higher quality growth.\nIn the past five years, the transition of China's growth pattern has created uncertainties in its investment market, which resulted in a slowdown of foreign investment inflow, said Seyedin. \"But all of that uncertainty seems to be going away at this point and with the 19th CPC congress, we'll have a very clear map and direction for going forward.\"\n\"At 6.9 percent growth, China produces more quality jobs than it did when it grew at 12 or 13 percent, especially in the manufacturing sector. So the growth transition is on its way and we certainly believe that the future is going to be bright,\" said Seyedin.\nAccording to figures released by Chinese Academy of International Trade and Economic Cooperation under the Ministry of Commerce, in the past, nearly 70 percent of foreign investment flowed to China's manufacturing sector, while 30 percent went to the service industry.\nNow around 65 to 70 percent of China's foreign investment flows to the service industries especially to knowledge, technology and talent intensive areas, while the high-end manufacturing has attracted about 30 percent.\nBut there are still some areas in the service sector not open to overseas investors, said Daniel Liao, China president of Singaporean company City Developments Limited.\nThe company has invested about $1.7 billion in the real estate, environmental protection and new energy sectors in major Chinese cities in the past six years.\nThe report said China will relax controls over market access in the service sector, which will attract more high-quality foreign investment to the sector and create more investment opportunities for foreign investors, according to Liao.\n"}

That would put him on a par with Zhu Rongji, known for his tough approach to tackling the economic chaos when he was vice-premier and central bank governor from 1993 to 1995.\n“Liu He stands out from the other candidates because the top leadership has decided that only a highly trusted and resourceful figure can take the lead on increasingly complicated reforms,” one of the sources said.\nXi picks team of problem solvers to head China’s economic portfolios\nLiu also stands out because China is considering a major restructure of its top government agencies. One of the proposals on the table is to elevate and expand the functions of the central bank, according to sources.\nThere has been speculation that the central bank could take up some of the responsibilities of the top economic policymaking agency, the National Development and Reform Commission, and the Ministry of Finance.\nOn Saturday, Xinhua reported that the elite Central Committee would discuss a plan to restructure party and government agencies at a plenary session early next week.\nThe restructuring and the appointment of a new central bank governor will be key to China’s efforts to tackle financial risks, which is now a top government priority.\nChanges at the top during a broader reshuffle can be subject to last-minute changes in China, and many other names have been reported as front runners to replace Zhou when he retires after a decade and a half in the job.\nThey include Guo Shuqing, chairman of the China Banking Regulatory Commission, Jiang Chaoliang, Hubei party secretary, Yi Gang, deputy governor at the central bank, and Liu Shiyu, chairman of the China Securities Regulatory Commission.\nWhat Beijing’s super regulator means for China’s economy\n“It’s not final, but currently Liu is ahead of the other candidates,” a second source said. “The leadership has high hopes that the new governor will be able to win the battle against financial risks and coordinate reform needs in the financial sector and for state-owned enterprises.”\nLiu is director of the Office of the Central Leading Group for Financial and Economic Affairs and a vice-chairman of the top planning body, the National Development and Reform Commission.\nHaving spent most of his career in government think tanks, Liu was reportedly introduced by Xi as someone “very important” to him when he met a visiting US delegation in 2013.\nHe is also regarded as the mastermind behind Xi’s supply-side structural reform. In an analysis in government mouthpiece People’s Daily in May 2016, an “authoritative person” believed to be Liu said high-speed growth was a thing of the past – and that sustainable economic development could only be achieved through structural adjustment and innovation.\nSince he was elevated to the 25-member Politburo at the Communist Party congress in October, Liu has been widely expected to take a front-row seat in steering the Chinese economy. He is also set to become the head of the cabinet-level Financial Stability and Development Committee.\n\nLast month, Xi sent him to lead China’s delegation at the World Economic Forum in Davos. He told the world’s rich and powerful at the Swiss ski resort that China would open its domestic markets wider and that this year’s reform measures could “exceed the international community’s expectations”.\nLiu is also expected to visit Washington next week as China seeks to ramp up top-level engagement with the US to defuse trade tensions.\nZhao Xijun, associate dean of Renmin University’s school of finance, said there were parallels between China’s economy today and in the 1990s.\n“China’s complicated economic and financial situation is similar to that of the ’90s, when Zhu was in charge,” he said. “And the challenging role of China’s central bank calls for a capable leader.”\nIn the aftermath of a global recession in the early 1990s, the Chinese economy was crippled by excessive fixed-asset investment, redundant monetary supply and a chaotic financial market – problems China is still grappling with more than 20 years on.\nChina unveils super financial regulator headed by vice-premier\nZhu tightened money supply, reformed the tax system and the state banking sector and cleared the debts of state-owned enterprises – if Liu does take charge on the economy he will face similarly thorny issues. They include reducing the leverage of SOEs, making financial institutions serve the real economy and preventing systemic economic and financial risks, Zhao said.\nGary Liu Shengjun, head of the China Financial Reform Institute in Shanghai, expected Liu to spearhead financial and economic reform in the next five years.\n“He’s trusted by the top leadership, respected in academia and he also has connections in the State Council because he used to work with the cabinet’s think tanks. He’s prudent and he’s a problem solver,” he said. “I think we will see Liu seizing this opportunity to realise his ambitions as a liberal intellectual and pave the way for further reform and opening up.”\nIs China’s central bank boss Zhou Xiaochuan about to retire?\nRegardless of who takes the central bank governor role, the job will be a lot different from 10 or 20 years ago, said Aidan Yao, senior emerging Asia economist at AXA Investment Managers.\n“At that time the main goal was to nurture a market-driven economy with a complete financial system, so the work was more to do with internal liberalisation,” Yao said.\n“Now, as China’s economy and banking system are much bigger and far more complicated, the key tasks will also include external liberalisation – opening up markets that are restrictive to foreign investment as well as capital accounts.”\nBut he said a new line-up of officials “won’t change the fact that all big decisions regarding development direction or the pace of liberalisation will be decided by president Xi”.\n“These people will serve, first and foremost, as advisers to president Xi to implement and execute what he wants,” he said.\nAdditional reporting by Xie Yu\nYou are signed up.

Evergrande's shares surged 18.08 percent on the Hong Kong stock exchange to close at HK$20.90 ($2.68) per share on Wednesday.\nThe rally continued on Thursday as it jumped 6.7 percent higher at opening to HK$22.30 per share.\nCompared with the start of HK$5.04 per share on the first trading day this year, the stock had soared more than 340 percent as of opening Thursday.\nXu currently holds 10.16 billion shares or 77.87 percent of the company's shares, according to publicized data.\nThe share surge came after a better-than-expected first half forecast.

[Photo by Wang Kangkang/For China Daily]\nChina's pet market will grow annually at an average 20.5 percent to exceed 200 billion yuan ($29.5 billion) in sales by the end of 2020, according to an industry report from Guangzhou Yourpet Network Technology Inc.\nThe growing number of pet owners in China are more willing now than in the past to spend on their furry friends, spawning an industry chain covering products and services. The focus is no longer on just animal breeds and veterinary services.\nBranded food, imported medicine, and a plethora of lifestyle-related products like pet cages, shampoos, showers, beauty items and garments are prominent pet products.\nServices comprise food and nutrition clinics, photography, beauty parlors, insurance, styling, nail painting, grooming, pet walks, healthcare, training and pet hotels.\nThe last-mentioned business line has taken off in a big way in China. For instance, Banlv Vet, a pet hotel in Ningbo, Zhejiang province, is equipped with a sanitized surgery room, a secure access system, a centralized temperature and humidity control system and closed circuit TV cameras that monitor every room.\nIt is now upgrading its facility to make sure every furry little guest has a wonderful stay while its owners are away. \"Last year, we invested quite a lot in upgrading to the modern system, including the cage made of better material,\" said Xu Shanshan, a vet and the owner of Banlv Vet. \"Pet owners are becoming picky about services like pet hotels. They would love to pay more for better services like branded food, imported medicine and pet shampoo.\"\nBanlv started as a small vet shop outside a residential compound five years ago. Back then, it used to have only one retired vet on its staff. It also had simple foldable pet cages and an open surgery table. Banlv is beefing up its staff with more veterinary graduates and pet nurses.\n\"It used to cost 20 yuan for a small-sized dog shower. Now it costs 50 yuan, and hundreds (of yuan more) for styling, nail painting and grooming,\" said Wang Yunya, a regular customer of Banlv. \"During Spring Festival, I spent 2,000 yuan for my three little dogs to stay here for a week.\"\nAccording to the National Statistics Bureau, China is on its way to becoming the third-largest pet market after the United States and Japan. From 2010 to 2016, the local market has been growing annually at almost 50 percent on average.\nNeil Wang, president of the China unit of Frost& Sullivan, a global consulting firm, said per-capita GDP in China has reached $8,576, laying the foundation for a boom in the pet market. Higher incomes, he said, spur consumption upgrades and people are more willing to pay for better food, healthcare, beauty products and training for their pets.\nBut the market is some distance from producing its first unicorn startup. Companies in the pet market are still busy building their brands. Wang Tiange, who owns five Chihuahua dogs, said, \"Sometimes, I don't know which Chinese dog food to buy because there are so many of them and none of them is a dominating brand. And I don't think there is a recognizable brand in dog clothes or other daily products. So I usually buy imported brands.\"\nNeil Wang said China has too many small companies in the pet market, more so because of insufficient regulation. However, with more investors entering the market, it will hopefully see some big companies leading the way in future, he said.\n"}

Two cities — Dongguan and Zhengzhou — made it to the list for the first time this year.\nWhile there is no official ranking, cities in China are often categorized according to tiers based on gross domestic product (GDP), population and level of political administration. Shanghai, Beijing and Guangzhou are widely cited as first tier cities.\nThe Rising Lab study took into account the cities' performance in five areas, including availability of commercial resources, connectivity and livability. Other than the usual data points, such as GDP, factors such as the number of retail stores and bars operating in the city were also considered.\nRising Lab's study raised eyebrows, however, by including Dongguan on its list of top cities. A manufacturing hub in Guangdong province, it's been best-known outside of China for undergoing a crackdown on its red-light industry.\nSome users on Chinese social media platform Weibo were dismissive of the study. \"Isn't \"new first-tier city\" just a nicer way of referring to second-tier cities?\" one user asked.\n\"If Dongguan did not go through the anti-vice campaign, it would have become a first-tier city even sooner,\" another Weibo user joked.\nOther users suggested that the rankings were just an excuse for individuals to speculate in the real estate market. This was especially because housing prices and living costs in some lower tiered cities were similar to those in the first tier, but wages resembled those in third or fourth-tier cities, one Weibo user argued.\nWhile cooling measures have had some impact on the rise in home prices, the potential of a bubble in the property market has been regarded as a risk to the economy by some.\nThe Rising Lab report cited greater inbound investment, including the move of a Huawei data center from Shenzhen to Dongguan, as a reason for bumping the latter up the rankings. Dongguan's status as a hub for electronics manufacturing also played a role for the upgrade, the report said, citing existing Oppo and Vivo factories in the city.\nAnother factor contributing to Dongguan's newfound first-tier status has been the number of international brands that have been attracted to open up shop in the city in recent years. Japanese retailer Uniqlo opened seven outlets in Dongguan over the past four years, while the number of Starbucks stores has more than doubled, the study reflected.\n\"I am kind of surprised that Dongguan would be seen as approaching first tier city status and I'd probably put it outside the top twenty cities in China,\" China Market Research Group Principal Ben Cavender told CNBC, adding that Dongguan falls outside the top twenty in terms of commercial real estate investment.\nOther media reports suggest Dongguan has seen better days as factories in the manufacturing hub move to more competitive economies in Southeast Asia.\nStill, developmental projects, such as China's wide-reaching \"One Belt, One Road\" initiative, could potentially improve Dongguan's fortunes. The city intends to become a logistics hub of sorts between the two routes that make up OBOR, according to local media reports last month. With infrastructure plans underway, businesses in the city would also be able to further explore export markets along the route.\nCities that are emerging as logistics hubs, such as Kunming (a second-tier city which wasn't included on the list), could also benefit from OBOR-related investments in rail and airport facilities as trade and human capital flows increase, Cavender suggested.\n\nPlaying\nShare this video...\nWatch Next...\n"}

For example, he expects all Ford models in China to feature onboard connectivity by 2019.\nFord's recent partnership with Chinese carmaker Zotye is intended to produce economy electric cars that better suit young customers. The 5 billion yuan ($754.4 million) deal, which was signed during US President Donald Trump's visit to China earlier this month, is a key step by Ford towards its vision of a cleaner, more environmentally sustainable future. The US carmaker announced earlier this year at least 70 percent of Ford-branded vehicles sold in China will offer electrified powertrain options by 2025.\nA plug-in Mondeo, the first plug-in hybrid to be produced at its passenger car joint venture Changan Ford, was unveiled at the recently concluded Guangzhou auto show. Ford also plans to offer an electric SUV in China in five years.\nLuo said Ford will make some exciting moves in 2018, including introducing the Ranger pickup into the Chinese market. The Ranger follows the F150, which has been well received after its entry into China in April.\n\"We have sold more than 800 vehicles so far. That is something we can take pride in for a high-performance pickup,\" said Luo.\nFord's premium arm Lincoln will prepare itself to localize an SUV model in 2019 at Changan Ford.\nSUVs are the sole growing segment in China this year, and Lincoln has been the fastest-growing premium brand so far in the market.\nIt sold 45,729 vehicles in the first 10 months of 2017, surging 85 percent year-on-year.\nFord is also planning some moves in the commercial car market, which has been dominated so far by local carmakers.\nLuo said the company will do something in terms of mobility and smart logistics, and reshuffle its current lineup. He added that Ford is also considering moves in the car segment.\n\"We will definitely introduce new cars to better serve the market. In fact, we are speeding up not only in product offerings but also in investment,\" said Luo.\nFord's 680 million yuan testing center in Nanjing, Jiangsu province, opened on Friday.\nIt is the first whole car testing center the carmaker has built in the country. Ford said it will speed up the development of cars to better meet the needs of customers in China and even Asia as a whole.\n"}

It compared to 10,000 and 8,200ï¼the number of such talents in Dalian and Tianjin, which followed the top 10 cities.\nShanghai topped the rankings with 122,000 people with skills in the field, accounting for nearly 17 percent of the national total, the report showed.\nDigital talents in those fast growing cities showed distinctive features, according to the report co-conducted by the Center for Internet Development and Governance under the School of Economics and Management of Tsinghua University and LinkedIn China.\nIn Suzhou, neighboring Shanghai, the number of talents in industries such as manufacturing, medicine, and architecture, with the integration of digital technology, is much higher than that in the basic industries of information, communications and technology, while in most other cities more than half of such talents are in ICT sectors.\nThe report showed that the number of such talents in manufacturing industry alone comprised 45 percent of the total in Suzhou, far surpassing those in ICT industries, which accounted for 28 percent.\nIt is closely related to the strategic positioning of the economic development of the city, which began focusing on manufacturing since 1994, said Chen Yubo, director of the CIDG.\n\"More than 100 of the Fortune 500 companies have built their factories in Suzhou and the city's innovation clusters, including an international technology park and eco-tech area, have taken shape and attracted more than 300 research institutions and high and new tech enterprises,\" he said.\nIn Chengdu, such talents also converged in the consumer goods and entertainment industries, besides manufacturing and finance.\nExperts said they believed the distribution of digital talents in the country will become more equal.\nLinkedIn statistics found earlier this year that talents in artificial intelligence accounted for only 17 percent of the total in the United States, and the rest scattered fairly equally all over the country, said Wang Di, vice-president of LinkedIn China.\n\"We'll see the rise of around 10 emerging cities (in China) that will be pioneering in digital-driven development,\" he said.\nThe report also found shortcomings in the current structure of digital talents as more than 85 percent of them specialize in product research and development, while those engaged in big data analysis, advanced manufacturing, and digital marketing accounted for less than 5 percent of the total.\n\"We believe the number of talents in these domains will rise quickly in the coming decade in response to the high market demand as the integration of digital technology into traditional industries will continue to be an important driving force of China's economic growth,\" Chen said.\n"}

It also does not use an extra layer of security known as a multi-signature system.\nThe hack has drawn into focus Japan’s approach to regulating cryptocurrency exchanges. Last year, it became the first country to regulate exchanges at the national level – a move that won praise for boosting innovation and protecting consumers, and that contrasts sharply with crackdowns in South Korea and China.\nThe FSA said it ordered Coincheck to submit a report on the hack and measures for preventing a recurrence by 13 February, and that it will, if necessary, conduct on-site inspections of other cryptocurrency exchanges.\nThe regulator also said it has yet to confirm whether Coincheck had sufficient funds for the reimbursement.\nBut the regulator does not have any rules banning the use of “hot wallets” by exchanges, nor does it set requirements on how much should be kept in “cold wallets,” an FSA official said at a briefing.\nIn response to FSA’s order for improvements, Coincheck said in a statement that it would promptly strengthen its customer protection and governance, and develop its risk management systems.\nJapan started to require cryptocurrency exchange operators to register with the government only in April 2017, allowing pre-existing operators such as Coincheck to continue offering services ahead of formal registration.\nThe FSA has registered 16 cryptocurrency exchanges so far, and another 16 are still awaiting clearance. Coincheck’s application was made in September.\n“It’s been long said that cryptocurrencies are a solid system but cryptocurrency exchanges are not,” said Makoto Sakuma, research fellow at NLI Research Institute.\n“This incident showed that the problem has not been solved at all. If Coincheck screws up its crisis management, that could deal a blow to the current cryptocurrency fever.”\nNEM fell to $0.78 from $1.01 on Friday but recovered to $0.95 late on Monday afternoon, according to CoinMarketCap. Cryptocurrency related shares mostly rose in Tokyo, with GMO Internet, which offers cryptocurrency exchange services, gaining 5.7 per cent.\nExchange operators in Tokyo said the Coincheck hack will likely cause concerns over security to grow among consumers, potentially pressuring the price of cryptocurrencies.\n“I have to admit that all cryptocurrencies will now be tainted in their minds, so there may be a mid-term negative impact,” said Genki Oda, president of BitPoint Japan.\nSingapore-based NEM Foundation said it had a tracing system on the NEM blockchain and that it had “a full account” of all of Coincheck’s lost NEM coins. It added that the hacker had not moved any of the funds to any exchange or personal accounts but that it had no way to return the stolen funds to its owners.\nIn 2014, Tokyo-based Mt. Gox, which once handled 80 per cent of the world’s bitcoin trades, filed for bankruptcy after losing around half a billion dollars worth of bitcoins. More recently, South Korean cryptocurrency exchange Youbit last month shut down and filed for bankruptcy after being hacked twice last year.\nWorld leaders meeting in Davos last week issued fresh warnings about the dangers of cryptocurrencies, with U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin relating Washington’s concern about the money being used for illicit activity.\nJapan’s top financial diplomat said regulation of cryptocurrencies would likely be on the agenda at the G20 finance chiefs’ meeting in Argentina in March.\nSouth Korea will this week ban cryptocurrency traders from using anonymous bank accounts to crack down on the criminal use of virtual coins. China, worried about financial risks from such trading, has ordered some exchanges in Beijing to close.\nAdditional reporting by Reuters\nWe’ve teamed up with cryptocurrency trading platform eToro.

It operates the spaces on rented real estate. Another three such spaces are in the pipeline.\nAdam Neumann, CEO of WeWork, said the fresh investment will be used to set up a new firm called WeWork China in partnership with Hony Capital, a local private equity firm, and SoftBank Group of Japan.\nWeWork China will expand operations to three to four new cities next year.\nWeWork will be responsible for management and operations of WeWork China, while Hony Capital and SoftBank will each own a minority stake, Neumann said.\nHe did not disclose details of the shareholding pattern in the proposed new firm.\nIn March last year, parent WeWork received $700 million in funding from investors led by Hony Capital.\nBy this year-end, WeWork China expects its co-work spaces to be used by about 15,000 customers, ranging from creators, entrepreneurs, small and medium enterprises to large multinationals.\nIt is not clear if WeWork China would own the premises or continue to rent commercial realty to set up its cowork spaces.\nNeumann said China has become a hub for business, finance and innovation, and WeWork is aiming to unlock opportunities for businesses. \"If we are not in China, we are not a global company. Our strategy is to work with local partners to better understand local culture and serve clients. So, we will set up the local entity with Hony Capital to focus on Chinese startups and large enterprises.\"\nNeumann said WeWork will seek to grow its customer base in China. \"By increasing our presence in China, we will help attract more foreign investment and companies into China and also help Chinese companies to go global.\"\nJohn Zhao, chairman and CEO of Hony Capital, said WeWork not only has a unique shared office space model but is creating a global network in which its customers can interact among themselves, creating synergy and demand for services and various other resources.\nZhao said WeWork has helped US media company STX Entertainment to develop its business in China by offering offices in Shanghai. There, STX uses WeWork's membership services and does business more conveniently, he said.\nAnother example is that WeWork has supported Chinese bike-sharing company Ofo Inc in the UK and the US.\nThe State Council, China's cabinet, released a guideline in 2015 for the development of shared work spaces in China to promote innovation and entrepreneurship.\nIt said China should set up professional shared work platforms to meet the requirements of startups.\n"}

[Photo/Agencies]\nE-commerce behemoth Alibaba Group's founder Jack Ma, who pledged on at least two occasions that the company would never enter the gaming industry, seems to have changed his mind.\nMa said in 2008 that the company \"would rather starve to death than live on games\". In 2010, he said that Alibaba would not invest one penny in games.\nBut the company did not stick to that principle too long. Alibaba Digital Media and Entertainment Group announced on Monday that it will establish a gaming business group.\nZhan Zhonghui, former chief operation officer of Net-Ease, will take charge of the gaming business group. Zhan joined NetEase in 1999 and left the company in 2011 to set up his own company EJoy in Guangzhou. During his time at NetEase, Zhan helped the internet company to grow its headcount from 10 to 4,000 and set up a leading game development team.\nChen Wei'an, product operation manager at EJoy for World of Warcraft and Starcraft 2, as well as Wu Yunyang, the leading developer at EJoy for the self-produced games Journey to the West 2 and Fantasy Westward Journey, will join Alibaba's newly formed gaming unit together with Zhan.\nIn an internal letter to all Alibaba's staff, Zhan said the company would \"pursue excellence as long as it steps into an industry\". The company will improve its ability in developing its own games and integrate research and development with operation in the hope of developing games that have high popularity and a good response from the market, he said.\nAccording to the China Gaming Industry Report jointly released on July 25 by Beijing-based Game Publishing Commission and market consultancies CNG and IDC, the sales revenue of the Chinese gaming industry surged 26.7 percent to 99.8 billion yuan ($15 billion) in the first half of this year, the majority 70 percent contributed by Tencent and NetEase.\nBut an Alibaba spokesman said the gaming market capacity is big enough to include more participants.\nAlibaba's Digital Media and Entertainment Group's Chairman and CEO Yu Yongfu said the gaming unit would leverage the resources created by its sister platforms such as online videos and movies.\nPrior to this official launch of its own gaming business group, Alibaba tested the waters at the beginning of 2014 by announcing the rolling out of its mobile games platform. In June of the same year, Alibaba acquired internet company UC mobile and games company 9Games. Two months later, it invested $120 million in US mobile game developer Kabam.\n"}

[Photo/Agencies]\nScalpers who expected to rake in huge profits from the sale of Apple's iPhone X may think twice as prices of Huawei Technologies new ultra-high-end smartphone soared to dizzying heights as of Wednesday and made it one of the most expensive models on sale in the country.\nPrices for the Chinese company's Porsche Design Huawei Mate 10, priced at 8,999 yuan ($1,360), rose to around 20,000 yuan ($3,023) in the country's leading online platforms of JD.com and Taobao.com, with the highest price peaking at 26,999 yuan.\nIn comparison, the price of its rival iPhone X on e-commerce websites was roughly similar or even lower than its official price tag.\nA Beijing-based retailer on Taobao.com, who sells Porsche Design Huawei Mate 10 at a price of 18,500 yuan, said that the high price is due to the limited supplies of the device. \"A lot of people have made enquires, but very few have made the purchases,\" he added.\nSince it became available in the Chinese mainland on Nov 15, Huawei has sold only a limited number of its ultra-high-end handset on its official online website at 10:08 am every Monday, Wednesday and Friday.\nChen Bo, a 38-year-old teacher, said that he failed to buy one from the official website even though he tried to buy after it opened for sales.\n\"I tried three times and it turned out that the type of phones were sold out within seconds. Jokingly speaking, it is harder to buy a Porsche Design Mate 10 than a Porsche,\" he said.\nWith a diamond black appearance and a custom Porsche Design interface, the 256-GB handset, as part of Mate 10 series, is targeted mainly at high-end consumers. It also boasts a slate of fancy artificial intelligence features such as intelligent photography.\n\"The ultimate reason is that there is an acute shortage of the Porsche Design Huawei Mate 10 handsets. The device uses an active-matrix organic light-emitting diode display screen from Samsung Electronics Co Ltd. The short supply of such screens may pose challenges for Huawei as it tries to catch up with the top smartphone firms,\" said Jia Mo, an analyst at market research company Canalys.\nUnveiled just a few weeks before the much-expected shipment date of Apple's iPhone X, Mate 10 series marks the company's efforts to challenge Apple in the premium segment.\n\"Given that the competition has just started, it does not mean that the Porsche Design Huawei Mate 10 will sell better than the iPhone X in the fourth quarter,\" he added.\n"}

Her company now has a research and development team of nearly 10,000 employees.\nIn a larger picture, in the first half of this year, high-tech and equipment manufacturing sectors are leading the country's industrial growth, with year-on-year output increases of 13.1 percent and 11.5 percent, respectively, compared with a 6.9 percent rise in overall output.\nStronger gov't drive\nMeanwhile, the Chinese government have never ceased its efforts to push the industrial upgrading progress to a further stage.\nAccording to decisions at a State Council executive meeting chaired by Premier Li Keqiang on Wednesday, China will establish national-level demonstration areas for the \"Made in China 2025\" plan, a blueprint to upgrade the country's manufacturing sector.\nThe national demonstration areas will be established in cities and city clusters in the eastern, central and western regions and help speed up the transformation of the country's manufacturing sector, create innovative mechanisms and facilitate opening up and cooperation.\nThe \"Made in China 2025\" strategy was first unveiled in 2015 to promote the manufacturing sector to be smarter, greener and more service-oriented.\nSince its launch, average productivity is up by 38 percent for China's first 109 pilot projects in smart manufacturing, while operating costs have dropped by 21 percent, data from the MIIT showed.\nA variety of government and industry funds will be used to spur innovation and entrepreneurship, and guide more social capital to support advanced manufacturing, according to the cabinet meeting.\nIn the demonstration areas, the government will offer stock incentives for employees of some state-owned enterprises.\nThe priority of boosting manufacturing is to attract both the talented people and funds to the real economy, said Li Beiguang, an official with the MIIT.\nAt the National Financial Work Conference that ended last Saturday, a key meeting held every five years since 1997, China also unveiled reform plans to make the financial sector better serve the real economy.\n\"From the medium and long-term view, China's manufacturing sector is on the eve of 'explosive growth,'\" said Zuo Shiquan, head of the equipment manufacturing research institute under the China Center for Information Industry Development.\nAlthough pressure remains from industrial transformation and upgrading, Zuo said he could see a convincing trend of a future turnaround.\n"}

It gave him a \"sense of belonging\".\nIn China, more and more cities have offered credit-based services to citizens. And more and more people, such as Zhang, have begun to own their credit scores.\nAt a forum on credit system building in Hangzhou earlier last week, representatives from more than 300 Chinese cities jointly released a declaration. Their aim will be to improve people's well-being by enhancing credit building in the country.\n\"The credit economy has kicked off in China,\" said Lian Weiliang, deputy head of the National Development and Reform Commission.\nThe central government has issued several documents encouraging and guiding the social credit system during the past three years.\nWithout any deposit, one can borrow a bike, power bank, library book or umbrella with the help of a smart phone.\n\"The building of a credit city has made urban life easier and city governance more efficient,\" said Zhu Dehai, deputy secretary of the city government of Huaibei in Anhui province.\n\"In Hangzhou, credit is cash,\" said Peng Lei, president of Alibaba's financial arm Ant Financial. She said citizens with good Alipay credit could enjoy privileges in various public services and urban living.\nAccording to Ant Financial, Alipay has exempted more than 38 billion yuan of deposits for its users, including 4 billion yuan in bike-sharing fees.\nExperts said that due to an unsound credit system in China, deposits were amounting to trillions of yuan, leading to heavy social management costs.\nThere are more than 3,000 public libraries in China. But most of them have few visitors. According to Guangzhou Library, local citizens visited it just 1.15 times on average last year.\nBut because of the credit borrowing service, citizens in many cities can now visit digital libraries, place orders online and have their books delivered to the door step.\nA survey targeting more than 100 city mayors and managers in the country revealed that 81 percent felt it would take up to 10 years before China became a credit society.\nBut more than half said their city had already started credit building.\nStatistics from Ant Financial showed that nearly 300 million Chinese had enquired about their credit records or enjoyed credit services.\n"}

He told Reuters last year that the industry had fallen behind other sectors when it came to embracing new technology due to the financial crisis.\n“We’ve been a bit distracted. The industry pretty much failed and then we’ve been in remediation mode and fix mode ever since,” he said.\nFlint spent the first 14 years of his career with HSBC in Asia, helping to establish and expand the bank’s markets business in the region before moving back to London in 2004.\nBefore becoming the chief executive of retail banking and wealth management in 2013, he worked across different functions that included group treasurer, head of global asset management business and group head of strategy and planning.\nBesides Flint, global banking and markets head Samir Assaf, its Europe chief Antonio Simoes and finance director Iain Mackay were among the most often cited contenders for the CEO’s role at HSBC in the past year.\nAnalysts said HSBC’s push into Asia, and mainly China, could have influenced the selection of Flint.\n“It’s been very much about continuity, they have been successful, they continue to be highly profitable as banks go. So why you’re going to change something that works?,” said Keith Pogson, EY’s Asia financial services lead based in Hong Kong.\n“Under Stuart (Gulliver), they had a very clear focus on the Pearl River Delta. I would expect under John (Flint) they would continue to take the same course. It’s a straight forward message — follow the money.” (Reporting by Sumeet Chatterjee; editing by Alexander Smith)\nAll quotes delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.

The tram operates on a 136-year-old railway line in Tangshan.\nWith the ability to produce about 50 such trams each year, CRRC Tangshan is introducing the vehicle to other cities, including Quanzhou in Fujian province, Taizhou in Zhejiang province, Tianjin, and Toronto in Canada.\nAccording to Li, the tram has three carriages with 66 seats, can run for 40 kilometers with a maximum speed of 70 kilometers per hour, and can be refueled with 12 kilograms of hydrogen in 15 minutes.\n"}

Starting at 999,800 yuan, Maserati sold all 100 cars in 15 minutes last year. [Xu Kangping/for China Daily]\nJD Fashion and Alibaba's Pavilion site battle it out to showcase blue chip brands as they root out internet fakes\nLuxury labels are at the center of a new online battle between Chinese internet giants looking to cash in on the consumer craze for designer fashion.\nBig players such as JD.com Inc and Alibaba Group Holding Ltd are going head-to-head to capture a market which is worth billions of dollars a year.\nIn a move to dominate the industry, JD Fashion was rolled out earlier this year.\nThen in June, parent company JD.com announced a strategic partnership with Farfetch UK Ltd by taking a $397 million stake in the London-based online fashion group.\nTwo months later, Alibaba hit back by launching the Luxury Pavilion site for blue chip brands on its e-commerce platform Tmall.\n\"We are making a major push in fashion this year,\" said Liu Hong, general manager of jewelry, luxury goods and accessories at JD Fashion. \"The next frontier of e-commerce is fashion and we plan to win it.\"\nLess than a decade ago, the majority of top-of-the-range labels were bought by Chinese consumers when they traveled abroad.\nMany were personal shoppers, who would bring back preordered designer brands to avoid custom tax, a practice known as daigou.\nBut those days are being consigned to history as high-end retail districts sprout up in major cities, such as Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou and Shenzhen, catering for the affluent middle class.\nA report by the consulting firm Bain & Co showed that China remains an \"engine of growth\" for luxury fashion items, capturing 30 percent of the global market last year, which was a slight decrease compared to 2015.\nStill, in another research document, KPMG, one of the big four global auditors, revealed that up to 50 percent of domestic luxury consumption in China will be generated online by 2020.\nWith eye-watering figures like these being bandied around, it is hardly surprising that JD.com and Alibaba are starting to make waves in the sector.\n\"The newly-created JD Fashion is a separate business unit with a staff of more than 1,000 people, which demonstrates our commitment to this market,\" said General Manager Liu.\nTo help mastermind the operation, the e-commerce juggernaut brought in Winston Cheng to spearhead its international business development.\nHe had previously worked for LeEco, the multinational electronics conglomerate based in Beijing.\n\"We are putting resources into Europe and the United States to win over brands, and prove how serious we are about the luxury sector,\" Liu said.\nAlready JD.com has lined up leading labels, such as Swiss watch maker Zenith and Austrian jeweler Swarovski, as well as Trussardi and Tag Heuer.\nThe deal with Farfetch in the UK has further strengthened its grip on the industry.\nJD.com has even wheeled out a \"white glove\" express delivery service in which smartly dressed couriers in electric cars drop off purchased items to customers.\n\"Luxury fashion brands will see that we really understand them,\" said Liu, adding that the company plans to roll out more initiatives without going into details.\nLast year, China's cross-border e-commerce import transactions reached 1.2 trillion yuan ($180.2 billion), an increase of 33.3 percent compared to 2015, a report released by China E-Business Research Center revealed.\nThis year that figure is expected to increase by 54.5 percent to 1.85 trillion yuan.\nWith so much at stake, Alibaba has been quick to take up the challenge by launching Luxury Pavilion.\nThe new site on Tmall features an array of designer labels from apparel, perfumes and beauty products to watches and jewelry from Burberry, Hugo Boss and LVMH-owned marque names Guerlain and Zenith.\nPart of Luxury Pavilion's appeal is that leading labels can launch their \"official stores\" on the site and run the businesses on a daily basis.\n\"Luxury brands increasingly want to use new retail technology and consumer insight to connect with younger shoppers, as well as drive business-model innovation,\" said Liu Xiuyun, the head of Tmall's fashion business.\nCombating counterfeit brands has also become a priority with JD.com taking a tough stance by controlling inventories and vetting retailers on its fashion site. The move has paid off.\n\"As a testament to our commitment to authenticity, we have become the first and only Chinese e-commerce company to join the American Apparel& Footwear Association, where we will work with them on intellectual property issues,\" General Manager Liu said.\nAlibaba has gone down a similar road to beat the \"pirates\".\nEarlier this month, the online giant joined forces with the Kering Group to weed out counterfeit brands.\nThe French company based in Paris owns labels such as Gucci, Yves Saint Laurent, Balenciaga, Alexander McQueen and Bottega.\nProtecting those intellectual property rights in China has become a priority as the group rides a new wave of online shopping.\n\"Luxury brands are catching on and e-commerce is the next frontier for growth in a crucial market,\" said Liz Flora, editor of the Asia Pacific region for market research company L2.\nBut the problem of fake labels has left many online shoppers wary of buying luxury items, Lu Zhenwang, CEO of Wanqing Consultancy in Shanghai, stressed.\n\"Making sure the authenticity of luxury products will boost customer confidence in China (and increase sales),\" Lu said.\n"}

That will lift the country's growth prospects, added Ulrich, who is a well-known expert on the world's second-largest economy.\nSpeaking from the sidelines of the Fortune Global Forum in Guangzhou, China, Ulrich highlighted China's newest inventions: \"China's payments system is number one in the world in terms of size and sophistication, and also the sharing economy. So we're really seeing innovation taking hold in the whole economy.\"\nMany Chinese tech companies are \"planting seeds\" in Southeast Asia and North Asia, and Ulrich said she expects more to venture abroad.\nChina's economic growth has largely surpassed expectations this year, helped by a global recovery in exports. That has boosted corporate earnings and allowed the country to cut financial leverage, which has been a key source of concern among investors.\nAn increasing number companies in the troubled steel industry, a major source of risky debt in the Chinese economy, are profitable now, Ulrich said. She noted that 85 percent of steel companies are making money today, compared to just 5 percent two years ago.\n\"For the first time since the financial crisis, financial leverage in China is coming down because corporates, the heavy borrowers from banks, are finally making a lot of money,\" she said.\n\"So they're paying down some of their debt, and, as a result, we're seeing leverage ratio coming down. Having said that, many Chinese banks have grown so rapidly therefore as you grow, as you lend, you need more capital. So I think for the smaller banks, in particular, they need to replenish their capital position before they can grow into the new year,\" added Ulrich.\nThe International Monetary Fund on Thursday morning released its assessment of the Chinese financial system.

Their campaign has been stopped after group stages for the third time, after a 2-1 defeat to Qatar in Changzhou on Monday.\nChina's last game against Qatar was just like their journey in the tournament - a disappointing end after a \"dream start\". When looking for a defining moment of the tournament for China, some commentators point to the unlucky effort from Wei Shihao in the game against Uzbekistan. The left winger could have earned the hosts a point if his injury-time attempt was just a few centimeters lower than the crossbar. However, it should be recognized that there is still a big gap between China and the top teams in Asia.\nAs tournament hosts, much was expected of Massimiliano Maddaloni's talented squad which featured six members of the senior national team. This is despite the fact that China has been knocked out at the group stage without any points in the past two editions of the competition.\nBut a 3-0 win over Oman in the first match was not enough to send them into the last eight. A narrow 1-0 defeat to an impressive Uzbekistan side saw the hosts drop to the third spot in Group A, a position which does not afford them a place in the next phase of the tournament.\n\"I feel disappointed by our performance (against Uzbekistan). We missed some chances that we had created, and I believe we were not at all calm during the match,\" Guangzhou Evergrande's rising star Tang Shi, said after the loss to the central Asia team.\nBeing not calm on the field did seem to be a problem for these youngsters. In their last match against Qatar, the players became anxious and lost their temper when the game was not on their side, even the captain He Chao was sent off after being handed a second yellow card before the break. This was the turning point in the match, as Qatar equalized just two minutes later.\nFailing to qualify may not satisfy the players and the home fans, but this outcome cannot be described as a failure. After all, there was some improvement for China compared with the last two editions; at least they claimed their first victory of the tournament. The impressive performance from some of the promising talent in the team should comfort fans to some degree.\nThe 22-year-old Wei Shihao has been a real find for China in the tournament. The pacey left winger, who just sealed a permanent move to Chinese Super League side Beijing Guoan from Portugal's Leixoes, contributed one goal and one assist in the opening game against Oman.\nThe Anhui native spent the majority of the past year on loan at Shanghai SIPG where he was able to receive more game time thanks to CSL's U23 policy, which requires clubs to field at least two players under the age of 23 in each game. Wei made a name for himself in Japan in December at the East Asian Championship when he scored on his senior national team debut in their fixture against South Korea.\nThe three games in Changzhou have proved the young players have a strong desire to win, but their technical and tactical abilities are still far from the best in Asia. In the past season, some U23 players have improved a lot under the domestic league's U23 policy, but there is still a long way to go for them.\nThere was no need to criticize the players after the exit, just like there was no need to praise them excessively after the first match against Oman. To honestly confront the gap in quality and to concentrate on youth training are the most important goals for Chinese football.\nSix greatest archeological discoveries of China in 2017 announced\nChina's giant pandas leave for Finland\nUN Palestinian refugee agency launches crowdfunding campaign following U.S. aid cut\nPalestinian workers make chocolate Ras el-Abd in West Bank city\nBest Xinhua China photos of the year 2017\nSnow, icicles seen at Hukou Waterfall\nBest Xinhua sports photos of the year 2017\nBest Xinhua world photos of the year 2017\n"}

Siasun's goal is not to catch up but to innovate on the basis of cutting-edge technologies to outcompete foreign rivals.\nCurrently, the Shenyang-based company's industrial robots and other products are exported to more than 30 countries and regions. Moreover, two-thirds of Siasun's customers are foreign companies.\n\"But that is not enough. We plan to build research and development centers in Europe, North America and Japan to accelerate our overseas expansion,\" Qu said, without offering more details of the ambitious plan.\nLast year, Siasun bought Teutloff Training and Welding Education Non-profit Ltd Liability Company, a leading German mechanical engineering vocational school, for an undisclosed sum. The deal gave the company access to Germany's decades of experience in vocational training.\nIt has also teamed up with Israeli companies and universities in a China-Israel robot research institute in Guangzhou, Guangdong province. They are making joint efforts on the R&D of technologies such as artificial intelligence which Qu billed as of great importance to robots by giving them \"wings\".\nSiasun's intensified efforts to go global came as Chinese robot makers are making steady progress in technology and key robotics components, boosting their competence in the international arena.\nAccording to the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, China is now on par with foreign countries in voice and image recognition technologies. Also, about 50 percent of domestic robots are equipped with homegrown servomotors, a key element of sophisticated automated machines, solving the technological bottlenecks that impede the whole industry's development.\nOn Wednesday, Siasun also unveiled its latest in-house control panels, which are equipped with artificial intelligence capabilities. It also officially entered the medical robot sector with new products.\nLuo Jun, CEO of the International Robotics and Intelligent Equipment Industry Alliance, a Beijing-based industry association, said after years of development, many Chinese robot makers are venturing out into overseas markets but more efforts are needed to beef up R&D to gain a presence in foreign countries.\n"}

(Xinhua/Li Tao)\nChinese President Xi Jinping said on Monday that China would cooperate with the international community in opening up and seek win-win results through cooperation.\nXi made the remarks while meeting with Klaus Schwab, founder and executive chairman of the World Economic Forum (WEF), at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing.\nCurrently, the world economy has seen some positive momentum, but many problems faced have not been fundamentally resolved, he said.\n\"The three fundamental contradictions, namely insufficient global growth momentum, lagging global economic governance and imbalance in global development, which as I pointed out in Davos last year, are still prominent,\" Xi said.\nXi said that recently, the trend toward anti-globalization and protectionism had heated up, exacerbating risks and uncertainties in the world economy.\nThe fourth industrial revolution is on the rise, but it also contains many risks and challenges, Xi added.\n\"There are so many problems and challenges in the world,\" he said. \"It is still necessary to respond through equal consultations and strengthened multilateral cooperation.\"\n\"History has repeatedly proved that isolation can only lead to a dead-end alley, and only by opening up and cooperation can the road become wider and wider.\n\"The big country bears important and special responsibility in opening up. As a responsible major country, China will play an active role in bringing bright, stable and promising prospects to the world and make more constructive contributions.\"\nXi announced a series of measures to expand China's opening up, at the just-concluded annual conference of the Boao Forum for Asia (BFA).\n\"Words must be followed by actions and actions must be taken with resolve,\" said Xi, noting that it was a solemn commitment to the Chinese people and the people of the world.\nWhile saying China's cooperation with the WEF had coincided with the country's reform and opening-up process, Xi suggested that it was necessary for both sides to keep pace and advance with the times, strengthen cooperation and work together in pursuit of new driving forces for global economic growth, and find out practical and feasible proposals to address global challenges.\nSchwab said Xi's speech at the WEF annual meeting last year was impressive and highly appreciated by the world, and that his speech at the opening ceremony of the BFA Annual Conference 2018 also drew global attention.\nReferring to Xi's proposals on building a community with a shared future for mankind and building an open world economy, Schwab said they \"charted a course for cooperation among countries against the backdrop that economic globalization and the multilateral trading system are facing challenges.\"\nHe said the WEF proposed to promote economic globalization and multilateralism, and opposed protectionism and unilateralism.\n\"The WEF takes pride in cooperation with China over the past 40 years,\" Schwab said.\nHe said the WEF was ready to improve long-term cooperation with China in promoting the Belt and Road Initiative and innovative development.\nHe said he hoped that the two sides could make joint efforts in strengthening global governance system and seeking solutions to world problems.\n¡¡¡¡\nFive years on, Xiplomacy is reshaping China's global role for a better world\nXi's 'shared future' now a consensus\nWEF calls for 2018 year of collaboration, multilateralism against global challenges\n"}

But should the praise for the country's increased attactiveness to investors go to his predecessor, François Hollande? What's wrong with the French prison service? And why you should have faith in the traditional media.\nPresident Emmanuel Macron has been busy selling France as the place for business and investment. That's the top story in the print edition of Le Monde.\nIt follows yesterday's meeting, in the sumptuous surroundings of Louis XIV's palace at Versailles, between Macron and the bosses of 140 big-name multinationals.\nWith Toyota and Facebook already signed on, France hopes to attract at least three billion euros of additional investment over the next five years.\nTomorrow the French leader will attend the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, where he's expected to present his view of globalisation to an audience of international movers and shakers.\nUS shutdown suspended\nLe Monde's electronic edition gives the honours to the US federal shutdown, which has been temporarily suspended, meaning that normal service can be resumed until at least 8 February. At the heart of the whole affair is the wrangle over the children of illegal immigrants, people that the Trump administration now wants to expel.\nFormer president Barack Obama created a special legal status for the \"Dreamers\", the 690,000 offspring of illegal immigrants, allowing them to work and study in the US. Trump overturned that status last September and has given Congress until March to find a permanent solution. Even his own Republican Party is divided on the issue.\nFrench prison system facing chaos\nRight-wing Le Figaro looks at the problems facing the French prison service.\nThere have been protests by prison officers for the past two weeks, obliging the police to take over the maintenance of order in seven penitentiaries.\nPrison officers are not allowed to go on strike but they do have the power to protest by, for example, unlocking cell doors to allow prisoners unlimited and uncontrolled access to open spaces in their establishments. This is what has been happening since two prison officers were attacked by a detainee 10 days ago.\nLe Figaro says there are two basic aspects to the problem: French prisons are overcrowded, and there are no special rules for the detention of the estimated 2,000 radical Islamist prisoners, many of whom are known to be extremely violent. Their numbers are boosted every month by the addition of those jihadist fighters arrested on their return from Syria and Iraq.\nThe basic pay for prison staff in France is 1,540 euros per month.\nPraise where praise is due\nLeft-leaning Libération follows Le Monde in devoting its front page to foreign investments and the ongoing charm offensive by President Macron.\nLibé's headline reads \"Thanks Hollande,\" and the small print explains that, of the 3.5 billion euros already invested and 2,200 associated jobs, the real credit should go to the last president, François Hollande, under whose wing the increasing attractiveness of France as a home for business investment was firmly established. At a considerable cost to the then-president's political popularity.\nLibé's editorial points out that billion-dollar investments are not decided in an afternoon at Versailles, they are carefully planned over years. So Macron will have played his part, in his capacity as one of Hollande's chief advisors and then as economy minister.\nSo we're looking at a continuous effort, says Libé. With just one crucial difference: when the Socialists were in charge, they tried to spread the benefits widely, causing panic and pain among the rich. Macron is following a different route, offering the bosses the best of both worlds.\nYou can count on us\nCatholic La Croix is happy to report that, in this era of fast, furious and fake news, the average French listener/reader/viewer continues to regard the traditional media - radio, press and TV - as most worthy of confidence.\nAccording to a recently published opinion poll, confidence is increasing in both the written press and television, with only one French person in every five considering information carried by the internet as credible.\nThese statistics mask a huge distinction between the older and well-educated parts of society, who tend towards the traditional media, and a younger less well-educated majority, who choose the internet as their primary source of information.\nEighty percent of those questioned would like to see some form of legislation to control fake news.\nMacron urges 140 world CEOs to 'choose …\nFrench prison strike enters 2nd week, …\nUN Security Council meets as Turkey …\nEscape of jailed Frenchman triggers …\nFrance condemns DRC police violence\nFrench artists, officials say 'No …\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

XIAO JIAN/CHINA DAILY\nStatistics from the National Development and Reform Commission show that major Chinese cities are faced with a shortage of parking slots as the ratio of cars to parking spaces is around 1 to 0.8 in those cities.\nIn Qingdao, a coastal city in East China's Shandong province, up to 10,000 existing parking slots have been transformed into shared ones with the help of Airparking, an online shared parking platform developed by Guangzhou Yueting Network Technology Co Ltd.\nThrough its app, users can either share or book a parking place. Owners who have idle parking slots can share detailed information including parking position, license number and time limit in the platform. With this information, users can easily find the nearest place to park.\nThe average parking fee for Airparking is four yuan ($0.6) per hour, almost the same as the service fee in traditional parking spaces, and the company will get half of the parking fee from lot owners.\n\"Different from building a parking place, which takes longer time and bigger costs, shared parking is more cost-efficient as it improves traffic order and optimizes resources,\" said Jiang Xiaohai, deputy chief of the Traffic Police Brigade for Shibei District, one of Qingdao's first areas to promote shared parking.\nQingdao is only one of the Chinese cities that encourage shared parking. Major cities including Beijing, Shanghai and Hefei have all begun to test the concept.\nThe Shanghai government, for example, upgraded more than 6,500 shared parking slots to encourage the public to use shared parking.\nIn fact, the idea of \"shared parking\" sprung up several years ago, but it has not been widely accepted by users.\n\"The biggest problem of shared parking industry is that it relies highly on the offline market, where many interest groups are involved. It is difficult to strike a balance among them,\" said Feng Zhidong, founder of Airparking and an expert in the field.\nUnlike other sharing economy sectors such as bicycles, the new parking method engages car owners, parking lot owners, property management companies and local governments. Even residents in the community where shared parking is located are concerned about the safety of their community if spaces are opened to all cars.\nFeng added that it is also one of the reasons why most shared parking companies in China are doing business on a small scale and have not become leading firms nationwide like car-hailing platform Didi Chuxing.\n\"Promoting scarce resources takes time. We try to convince various interests that this sharing mode actually will bring benefits. Even though faced with difficulties, we are still optimistic about the industry,\" he said.\nThe optimism is shared by consumers.\nLeng Bin, a resident from Qingdao who frequents central business districts, said: \"Finding a place to park used to be a headache for me, especially when I had to handle affairs in some difficult-to-park areas. Thanks to shared parking, it is no longer a problem.\"\n"}

Under our open-platform approach, we will continue to work with a range of automotive manufacturing partners to benefit Chinese consumers,\" an Alibaba spokeswoman said in an email.\nLocal newspaper China Daily reported that Alibaba would have an approximately 10 percent stake in Xiaopeng Motors following its investment.\nThe company's recent moves in the automobile space come after other major players comprising China's BAT companies — an acronym used to refer to Baidu, Alibaba and Tencent collectively — have made investments of their own in the electric vehicle space.\nTencent acquired a 5 percent stake in Tesla for $1.78 billion earlier this year. Both Tencent and Baidu have also invested in Chinese electric vehicle start-up Nio, while Baidu has backed WM Motor Technology, another electric vehicle start-up on the mainland, Reuters reported.\nXiaopeng Motors cooperated with Haima Automobile, a subsidiary of Chinese automaker FAW Group, to begin producing its first model this year, although a finalized version of the electric sports utility vehicle (SUV) is expected to hit the market only in 2018, state-run news agency Xinhua said.\nThe beta version of Xiaopeng's electric SUV has a mileage of 300 km and includes an autonomous parking feature, which enables the car to park itself without a driver.\nMeanwhile, He Xiaopeng, the chairman of Xiaopeng Motors and an angel investor, said in a Weibo post on Friday that the start-up had completed its series A+ round of funding and was on track to begin series B financing early next year.\nAlibaba's move into the automobiles comes as the company attempts to diversify as part of its \"new retail\" policy, which involves merging both the online and offline. The company announced earlier this month that it would work with Ford Motor to explore ways the companies could upgrade customer experiences in the automobile industry.\nFollowing that announcement, Alibaba presented one possible solution — vending machines which dispense cars.\nUnder that scheme, users will be able to browse car models on Alibaba's Tmall app before picking them up for a test drive at completely automated facilities, or car vending machines. Only users with scores above 700 on Sesame Credit, Alibaba's social credit scoring system, will be able to schedule test drives.\nAlibaba intends to build \"dozens\" of those vending machines in China in the next year. The company said on its Alizila platform that it would be opening two such facilities in Shanghai and Nanjing in January next year.\n\n"}

They're envelopes containing gifts of money given by married people to unmarried people — although many also have the practice of giving money to their parents.\nIn China, digital red packets have contributed to the growth of mobile payments, notably for Tencent social media platform WeChat.\nThe tech conglomerate only introduced e-hongbaos in 2014, but their popularity has skyrocketed. More than 16 million digital packets were sent on the eve of Chinese New Year in 2014, but that grew to 14.2 billion for the same day last year.\nThe phenomenon hasn't quite taken off in Southeast Asia in the same fashion, but consumers are starting to bite.\nSingapore-headquartered bank DBS declined to reveal total digital red packet numbers, but said that there were five times more e-hongbaos sent last year compared with 2016.\nMore importantly for consumers, DBS revealed that the average amount sent in digital red packets in Singapore last year was S$26 (about $19.60) — several times higher than the going rates of physical red packets, which is between S$6 ($4.50) and S$10 ($7.60).\nIn China, the festival also results in the largest annual migration of people in the world. During what is known as chunyun, a 40-day travel season, nearly 3 billion trips are expected to be made using public transport between Feb. 1 and March 12, according to China's Ministry of Transport.\nMany of those trips are made by city dwellers heading home, but many also take the time to go elsewhere, with top destinations being Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou.\nDomestic travel spending last year rose 15.9 percent from 2016, with 344 million domestic tourists spending 423.3 billion yuan ($61.5 billion), according to China's National Tourism Administration.\nIncreasingly affluent Chinese are also looking to travel abroad. Last year, 6.15 million Chinese travelers took international trips, a 7 percent increase from 2016, with overseas spending estimated to amount to about 100 billion yuan (nearly $16 billion).\nThe number is expected to grow again this year. Last week, a report from the China Tourism Academy and Ctrip said they expected the number of outbound Chinese travelers this year to reach a new record of 6.5 million.\nThese vacationers are expected to spend an average of about 9,500 yuan (about $1,500) and are looking to popular destinations such as Thailand, Singapore and Vietnam.\nCIMB private banking economist Song Seng Wun said Chinese New Year always brings a \"short-term lift for consumption for Chinese communities around the world from Beijing, Jakarta, London, Los Angeles, to Singapore.\"\nHe added that, in Singapore, some indicators of Chinese New Year spending that give him signals for the health of the economy are the demand for gift baskets and hampers and the queues for bakkwa – a sweet barbecued pork jerky in Singapore which sells for about $38 (S$50) per kilogram, and gets more expensive the closer it gets to the actual holiday.\n\"And since more and more Chinese are taking their long holiday breaks outside of China, I'll be watching out for how busy our Merlion will be over this Chinese New Year period,\" he said.\n\nPlaying\nShare this video...\nWatch Next...\n"}

It can be used to test 5G pre-commercial networking and support other trials, Huawei said in a statement.\nIn comparison, most of the testing machines are very heavy and some even need to be carried by a trolley.\nThese moves are part of China's broad push to commercialize 5G services in 2020.\nChina Mobile said it would deploy 10,000 5G base stations by 2020.\nHuang Haifeng, an expert at the leading telecom industry website cww.net, said China has evolved from a follower into a leader in the global telecom sector.\n\"The smallest 5G testing machine shows that China Mobile and Huawei have poured tons of resources into research and development, because 5G-enabled devices are far better than 4G devices in many aspects and it is hard to shrink the devices into a small size,\" Huang said.\n"}

But on the way he tripped himself up and - yet again - opened old sores concerning Japan's troubled relations with China.\nHis performance had even seasoned commentators wondering and worrying whether Abe in particular and Japan in general understand the complexity and delicate balance of relations in Asia or whether he is spoiling for a fight.\nIn his set speech, delivered in well-practised English replete with expressive hand gestures to indicate he was in charge, Abe devoted most of his time to promises that Japan is on the verge of sweeping domestic reforms that are going to transform the country.\nHe concluded with a plea for co-operation between countries and added that, \"The dividends of growth must not be wasted on military expansion. We must use it to invest in innovation and human capital, which will further boost growth in the region\".\nWithout naming China, he went on, \"Military budgets should be made completely transparent and there should be public disclosure in a form that can be verified.\" In addition, disputes should be resolved through \"dialogue and the rule of law, and not through force and coercion\".\nA leading Chinese professor attending the Davos meetings immediately labelled Abe a \"troublemaker\" and compared him to the erratic North Korean leadership.\nJust in case you think it unfair to judge him for comments on international matters when he was speaking mostly about Japan and at a session which is traditionally devoted to business, Abe went on to talk with international journalists and make some strange and rather scary comments about relations with China.\nMost strangely, he compared Japan's situation with China today to that of Germany and Britain on the eve of the Great War. He said the two countries today had a \"similar situation\" as Britain and Germany had in 1914, including a strong trading partnership, but this had not prevented tensions that spilled over into war.\nAbe did add that he would regard any \"inadvertent\" conflict as a disaster. When questioned further, he blamed the steady increase in China's military spending as a major source of instability in the Pacific region. He mentioned upcoming talks between the US and Japan on security and said that Japan \"would very much like to strengthen our military relationship with the US\".\nA Chinese journalist asked again about Abe's visit to the Yasukuni Shrine where the souls of Japanese war criminals are supposedly enshrined with the 2.4 million Japanese who died in war. Abe responded that he had intended to pay tribute to the dead of many wars and pointed out that he had specifically called at Yasukuni for Japan \"never again to fight a war\".\nJapanese officials had flagged the event as important, with Abe about to say something significant. Lionel Barber, the editor of the Financial Times, tweeted, \"Worry of the day: Abe's fourth arrow warning about China and comparisons with Britain/Germany pre 1914\".\nThe paper's chief economics commentator, Martin Wolf, said in a blog piece that Abe's view may be realistic, \"and maybe such realism will protect the world from such a calamity. But it frightens the wits out of me. I was particularly struck by the almost casual way in which Mr Abe cited the World War I precedent. I wish the US would step more decisively on this nonsense\".\nInterestingly, Kaiser Wilhelm of Germany gave an interview to the Daily Telegraph some years before the first world war, in which he protested that it was \"one of my dearest wishes to live on the best of terms with England … How can I convince a nation against its will?\" The kaiser thought he was reaching out to the British people, but the interview proved a key in turning popular opinion against him.\nThe Zero Hedge blog site declared of Abe's set speech: \"Comedy hour comes early today courtesy of Japan's PM Shinzo Abe who just started speaking on the topic of 'reshaping the world' at Davos. Like we said: pure comedy.\"\nWithout going that far, it was striking that Abe in the main part of his set speech promised radical changes without saying how he would achieve them or giving the sums showing that the changes would indeed transform the Japanese economy.\nHe had a long list of changes about to happen, including electricity market liberalisation; radical agricultural reform allowing big corporates into the sector; empowering women in the workforce; labour market deregulation; health care reform to encourage big companies; removal of building restrictions, so that \"the sky will be the limit\"; creation of many \"zero emissions towns\"; and a promise that he would be \"a drill bit strong enough to break through the solid rock of vested interests. No vested interests will be immune from my drill\".\nHe sounded like a megalomaniac magician pulling brilliant rabbits out of his hat. He may be able to legislate changes, but it is not so easy to change society. Abe's way is also against the Japanese tradition of nem awashi, of laying the foundations for agreement.\nIf he wants to succeed in his goals, many of which are laudable, Abe should not listen to his own voice so much, but should listen to others and quietly try to persuade them of his good will.\nThat applies also to China.\nKevin Rafferty is a professor at the Institute for Academic Initiatives, Osaka University\nYou are signed up.

The country targeted growth around 6.5 percent this year.\nSo far, the Chinese government has achieved little success in reining in debt growth in the last five to six years, as the country has a GDP growth target that requires more growth than the economy can generate organically. \"So, the only way to get there is with debt and with accelerating amounts of debt,\" said Pettis, who was a former managing director at Bear Stearns.\nReducing debt, while challenging, is unlikely to spur a financial crisis in China as the banking system is still closed and very controlled, he added.\nAnd although there are fears that a slowdown in Chinese growth will drag the world economy down, Pettis said it would not be as drastic as most imagine.\n\"China is the biggest arithmetical component to global growth, but it's not really the biggest contributor to global growth. What the world needs is demand, that's the most scarce resource,\" said Pettis.\nHowever, China's deleveraging will take a considerable amount of time to achieve.\n\"Deleveraging just means assigning the cost of debt to some sector of the economy, so the question is: Which is the sector that can absorb the cost with the least damage to the economy? And the answer is very clear and very straightforward: It's the local governments and the local elites,\" Pettis said.\nAs those entities grew faster than GDP in the three decades of breakneck growth in China, they will have to pay the cost of the debt now. Targeting them, however, is tough.\n\"There are the so-called vested interests. They are politically quite powerful so the process of forcing them to absorb the cost of the debt has been very difficult,\" said Pettis.\n\nPlaying\nShare this video...\nWatch Next...\n"}

As chairman of the China Banking Regulatory Commission since last February, Guo has led a campaign to curb financial risks that’s central to Xi’s plans, starting with a crackdown on shadow financing and measures to squeeze interbank market liquidity.\nHe then moved on to participating in a move to clamp down on overseas investments by top dealmakers, asking banks to detail loans to companies such as Anbang Insurance Group Co. and Fosun International Ltd.\nJiang Chaoliang\nJiang led the PBOC’s Shenzhen and Guangzhou branches during the Asian financial crisis before being promoted to assistant governor in 2000. During this stint, he handled the collapse of Guangdong International Trust and Investment Corp., China’s biggest-ever corporate bankruptcy at the time. Jiang has worked his way through key positions at several state banks and has served as the governor of Jilin province. He’s now the Communist Party secretary for Hubei, a province almost as populous as Italy.\nLiu He\nLiu, a member of Xi’s inner circle, is widely expected to be appointed vice premier in charge of financial and economic affairs, making him the president’s right-hand man on the topic. Should he also assume leadership of the central bank, it will send a very clear signal of the PBOC’s elevated status.\nAfter promotion to the Politburo last year, the power center of the Communist Party, the Harvard-educated economist has\nemerged from the behind-the-scenes as the “brain” behind the ongoing overhaul in the world’s second largest economy, and a spokesman representing China’s top leadership in international arenas from\nDavos to Washington.\nXie Fuzhan\nXie’s name has only been mentioned by analysts much later in the game, and it will be a surprise if he snatches the post. An engineering graduate who also was a visiting scholar at Princeton, Harvard and Cambridge, according to an official\nbiography, Xie now serves as party chief of Henan, the\nbiggest agricultural province.\nWhile Xie has little financial sector experience, he worked for nearly two decades in the State Council’s Development Research Center, overlapping briefly with Liu before rising to deputy director of the government-backed think tank in 1999. He was named director of the National Bureau of Statistics in 2006, a position that also involves serving as a member of the PBOC monetary policy committee, an advisory panel. He returned to the State Council in 2008 as director of the Research Office, giving him more influence over policy setting as a top adviser to then-Premier Wen Jiabao.\nYi Gang\nSelecting Zhou’s No. 2 at the PBOC would signal national leaders aim to keep monetary policy consistent as financial markets liberalize and economic growth slows from the soaring pace of past decades. Yi joined the central bank in 1997 and served in a succession of roles before his promotion to deputy governor in 2007.

Europe should take heed\nIn January this year a sober-suited President Xi Jinping made a bid for the mantle of global climate leadership. In a speech delivered to the global elite at the World Economic Forum in Davos, President Xi presented China as a reliable and responsible international player that stood by its commitments both to the Paris Agreement and to globalisation.\nIn diplomacy, as in life, timing matters. Xi’s careful speech, sober demeanour and his pledge to be a steady partner resonated all the more against the example of the new US president. Since then, much ink has been spilled on the important question of whether China will or can fill the gap created by the Trump administration’s departure from the stage. To assume that leadership, China’s own low carbon transition would need to serve as an example to others.\nXi’s careful speech, sober demeanour and his pledge to be a steady partner resonated all the more against the example of the new US president\nIt is a question of particular concern to the EU, once itself a leader in climate diplomacy but now distracted by its own difficulties. Although there is still action at state and city level in the US, both the EU and China have lost a key partner since Obama left office. They are looking at each other, speculatively measuring up for the role. Neither is likely to exert the diplomatic force that an engaged United States can bring to bear on the international negotiations. But, as important trade partners with a deep commitment to climate mitigation and some, though by no means a full set of overlapping interests, their cooperation on trade and investment should advance the climate agenda, despite the headwinds.\nSince Donald Trump announced the US “withdrawal” from the Paris agreement, Chinese and EU leaders have pointedly emphasised their joint commitment. In early June, they prepared a strongly worded 10-page statement on climate cooperation. But as a signal that cooperation is complicated, the statement was not signed: unresolved trade disagreements got in the way. As China becomes more of a competitor to Europe, such disagreements may deepen.\nEurope’s transition to a low carbon economy is a work in progress, now hampered by internal stresses and foot-dragging by some laggard member states. China’s transition is announced and underway, but many years, if not decades, from completion. A closer examination of China’s existing commitments and domestic raise some questions as to how useful a model it is for Europe.\nSince the 12th Five Year Plan (2011-2015) China’s strategic commitment has been clear: China is at the end of a 30 year cycle of rapid, high carbon growth, fuelled by investment, cheap labour and exports. That model has been exhausted for some years and is now as much a burden as an engine of growth. Its infrastructure building is increasingly a deficit exercise, its environmental legacy is toxic and its economic success is pricing China’s increasingly scarce labour out of the cheaper global markets it once dominated.\nTo power its route through the much-discussed middle income trap, China needs to follow Taiwan, South Korea, and Japan up the value chain, investing in technologies, innovation and efficiency. Low carbon technologies offer a double benefit — that of domestic climate mitigation and economic potential. China therefore has a direct interest in the carbon-constrained world that the Paris Agreement seeks to bring into being, if for no other reason that China intends to supply low carbon goods, services and technologies to that global market.\nIt is a project with a history of investment in renewable technologies that now allows China to boast the largest installed wind and solar capacity in the world and, importantly, to claim that its capacity to manufacture at scale has lowered the international price of solar panels by 80 percent in just a few years, transforming the balance of costs between high and low carbon energy sources for third countries. In addition, China is investing in the full range of advanced clean technologies, from battery storage and electric cars to robotics, with the aim of dominating future innovation and global technology. Its emissions are likely to peak by 2025 and the long march away from coal has begun.\nAnd yet, despite this effort, China’s pledges under the Paris Agreement are not ambitious and it remains unclear how far China will assert leadership beyond that afforded by its sheer weight in the world, now that US influence is shrinking. China looks after its own interests first and has rarely exercised diplomatic effort in defence or pursuit of global public goods. Xi Jinping’s current mission remains that of making China great again, a mission that Donald Trump has done much to advance.\nOn the positive side, China’s leaders are scientifically literate and comprehend the basic physics of climate change.  China itself is highly vulnerable to the impacts of warming: from melting glaciers on the Qinghai Tibet plateau, to rising seas that threaten its delta cities — Guangzhou, Shanghai and Tianjin. Add to that food insecurity and failing water supplies to most of north China and China’s leaders understand that the impacts on future prosperity are potentially huge.\nBut China’s actions at home have been bounded by a mix of vested interests and competing political and economic priorities that is familiar in other political systems.  The regime must worry about the jobs tied up in pouring concrete, processing petrochemicals, making steel and mining coal. It is under pressure from the huge state owned enterprises that are largely tied to the old economy. How much faster the regime can move without undermining the support of these key constituents remains uncertain: Xi is seeking to appease the high carbon industries with the temptations of the ambitious global infrastructure projects of One Belt One Road, while at home he still struggles to implement the crucial Third Plenum Reforms and little progress is expected before the critical 19th Party Congress later this year.\nMeanwhile, there are other issues to contend with: the last time the government shuttered zombie state-owned enterprises was when the then prime minister Zhu Rongji closed down the northern rust belt in the 1990s. The city of Shenyang, once the steel capital of China, subsequently blossomed as a garden city. Zhu was helped  by the abundant job opportunities afforded by double digit growth; today growth is around 6 percent and the jobs the new economy might offer — in services and in advanced technologies  — may not help those who will lose in the curtailment  of coal, steel and new infrastructure projects.\nChina has potential for new green jobs: Chinese researchers have estimated that between 2005 and 2020 China’s low carbon transition could create some 30 million green jobs across forestry, power generation and the green parts of 2009 stimulus package. But if China is to succeed, it must find more ways to ensure that the low carbon economy not only drives growth but also absorbs the relatively unskilled labour the government wishes to move off the land.\nChina is rapidly laying the groundwork of a new economy, rolling out a network of rapid charging stations for electric vehicles and continuing to invest in renewable technologies. Although at present China’s technologies are outmatched by others, there is every reason to suppose China can catch up through state investment and exploitation of its large domestic market.\nEU-China cooperation to date has been built on the synergies between more advanced EU economies that shared experience in everything from city planning to carbon trading, and the emerging China. That transfer of expertise could reverse if China succeeds, but beyond the headline message that the future is low carbon, it is not clear how closely China’s experience in creating a job-rich and prosperous green economy would read across to laggards within the EU.\nAlthough both have benefited, the EU runs a stubborn trade deficit with China and there are growing signs of alarm at the implications of China’s eagerness to invest in European advanced technologies with better IP protection and increasing levels of competition could complicate future cooperation. Continuing restrictions on market access in China and gaps between internal political and economic systems may make lessons less transferable.\nCoal dependent countries such as Poland, however, could find interesting models elsewhere: the state of Texas, for example, synonymous with the oil industry, is now the biggest generator of wind energy in the United States, and the fastest growing employment category is that of wind technician. In Texas alone, 22,000 jobs have been created by a wind industry that has thrown a lifeline to cattle ranchers stricken by climate related drought.

[Photo provided to China Daily]\nRegulations have been tightened for personal consumption loans to prevent lending from being abused in the housing market as a tool for property speculators.\nThe banking regulatory unit of the People's Bank of China, China's central bank, released a series of circulars in the past week that banks need to examine the use of personal consumption loans above 200,000 yuan ($30,400) with residential properties as mortgages.\nShenzhen banking regulatory authorities have required banks to shorten terms for personal loans from previously up to 20 years to no more than five years, while Guangzhou has stipulated that personal loans shall not exceed one million yuan, and the terms shall be no longer than 10 years.\n\"The move to tighten personal loans is obviously to prevent borrowers from applying for consumption loans while using it to speculate in residential properties, after banks tightened lending to home loan applicants amid nation-wide efforts to cool down the residential property market,\" said Wang Jiejing, a credit specialist with Bank of Shanghai.\nThe move is to reduce risk for banks, and also goes in alignment with the government's long-term mechanism to encourage stable and healthy development of the property market, he said.\n\"Tightening lending is one of the most powerful measures to cool down overheating in the residential market\", said Yan Yuejin, research director at E-house China R&D Institute.\nA recent research by the E-house China R&D Institute said that about 300 billion yuan, or 30 percent of the 1 trillion yuan personal consumption loans, are likely to be injected into the property market.\nBanks across China have been scrutinizing applications for home loans and increased lending ratings for home loans by up to 10 percent above the benchmark rate since the beginning of the year.\nIn Beijing, several banks have increased their rates for home loans by between 5 percent and 10 percent, said a circular by the operation management unit of the central bank on Tuesday evening.\n\"Banks' rate hikes for home loans are 'voluntarily', which reflects the trend after policies were tightened against speculation in the housing market, and is supported and encouraged by the authorities\", the circular said.\nBanks in Shanghai, Shenzhen, Nanjing and Guangzhou have also increased home loan rates.\nIn Zhengzhou, capital of Henan province, which has seen sharp new home price growth in the past 18 months, banks have increased home loan rates by up to 30 percent above the benchmark rate.\n"}

I'm a loyal fan of his.\"\nBut that loyalty isn't stopping him from betting big on something Buffett — the world's third-richest person — has publicly projected \"will come to a bad ending\": cryptocurrency.\nIf there's anything Ling learned from Buffett, he said, it is an appreciation for index funds. Ling, however, wants to apply that outlook to the digital currency realm.\n\"Cryptocurrencies like bitcoin are too volatile, and that's why we are launching cryptocurrency indexes,\" Ling told CNBC. \"Over the past six months, our index has a lower decline than bitcoin during corrections, but has outperformed bitcoin by 50 to 80 percent during upsurges.\"\nLing is launching the \"BB Index\" family of 26 cryptocurrency indexes. They're grouped by market capitalization, category and strategy, ranging from a \"Blockchain Top 7 Index\" that covers the largest cryptocurrencies to a \"Blockchain Top 50 ex top 20 Token Index\" that covers mid-cap assets. All BB Indexes are updated every three minutes on its official website, Ling said.\n\"Think about the risk management, (and) think about the correlation. Actually we have different indexes to help people find the desired expected return they pursue,\" said Jerry Cao, chief scientist of BB Index and a former assistant professor of finance at Singapore Management University.\n\"Rather than thinking, 'Hey this cryptocurrency will rise 10 percent tomorrow,' that's a very short-term view,\" Cao added. \"What we are really thinking is to extract from the short-term movement and think about one year or five years — what will be the application of those cryptocurrencies and their underlying blockchain?\"\nWhen asked what was the most memorable advice that Buffett shared with him during that $2.35 million lunch, Ling gave his answer without hesitation.\n\"Buffett touched on lots of issues during that lunch, but in the end, he said, 'Focus on what you are doing and you are already successful,'\" recalled Ling. \"This quote really left me with a deep impression and I followed his advice.\"\nHowever, Buffett has made it clear he believes the craze over cryptocurrencies won't end well.\n\"In terms of cryptocurrencies, generally, I can say with almost certainty that they will come to a bad ending,\" the chairman and CEO of Berkshire Hathaway said during an interview with CNBC's Betty Quick in January 2018.\nBut Ling disagreed with his idol this time, saying he is confident that BB Index returns will beat any traditional portfolio manager, including Buffett.\n\"Warren Buffett just won a 10-year bet that an index fund would outperform a collection of hedge funds over that time,\" said Ling. \"And I want to make a bet with him that my cryptocurrency index will outperform his portfolio over the same period.\"\nCNBC reached out to Warren Buffett's office for comment, but did not receive any response by the time this article published.\n\"We can understand why he doesn't touch cryptocurrencies. As long as we understand and focus on what we are passionate about, we are following his philosophy,\" said Ling.\nTo be sure, the market for cryptocurrency index funds is getting increasingly crowded, with major players flooding in.\nCoinbase, the leading U.S. marketplace for cryptocurrencies, announced in March it was releasing a weighted index fund to give accredited U.S. investors access to crypto assets.\nEarlier this month, U.S.-based Cryptos Fund launched a new entity to track its CCi30 index of the top 30 cryptocurrencies, accepting subscriptions from qualified investors starting from $10,000.\nAdditionally, Bitwise Asset Management, which claims to be the creator of the world's first crypto-index fund, HOLD 10 Private Index Fund, announced in late March that the fund now supports investment from self-directed individual retirement accounts (IRAs).\nIn Asia, meanwhile, the competition is heating up.\nUpbit, the largest cryptocurrency exchange by trading volume in South Korea, has announced the launch of the country's first domestic cryptocurrency index, Upbit Crypto Index.\nBut for BB Index's Ling, the ever-crowding battlefield could also mean opportunities for the market.\n\"Only with so many players launching cryptocurrency indexes together can we push the market to grow bigger as a whole,\" said Ling. \"The entire cryptocurrency index will eventually become a $5 trillion market in 5 years.\"\nAccording to Ling, a BB Index fund will soon be available on MatrixOne, a crypto trading platform launched by his company Supwin. Meanwhile, the index fund is aiming to launch soon on international exchanges, including Abu Dhabi Global Market in the second quarter of 2018, Huobi, a leading Chinese cryptocurrency exchange, and Bitwin Korea, a South Korean crypto exchange in which Ling invested.\nLing told CNBC that the index fund's over-the-counter pool size has reached $50 million and investment commitments of institutional and individual investors imply an additional capital inflow of $200 million after the fund's launch.\n\"Actually, most of these so-called 'committed funds' come from rich Chinese investors based overseas, but from my perspective, we want to basically introduce the index to institutional investors and that would be the future backbone of our users,\" Cao told CNBC.\nThe former professor said he sees a strong demand in Asia and BB Index aims to focus more on markets such as Singapore, Japan, South Korea and the Middle East.\nWith BB Index's official launch on the horizon, both Cao and Ling know it's going to be all about timing.\n\"We can't wait. We have to act fast,\" Ling said.\nBut indeed, he is waiting for a big market.\nThere's been a lot of interest from Chinese investors in BB Index, according to Ling.\nHowever, as China has banned cryptocurrency exchanges and initial coin offerings, crypto enthusiasts from the world's second-largest economy can only legally use coins or assets parked overseas to invest in crypto funds.\nLing said China's regulatory policy is very clear at this moment, but there may be a chance in the future.\n\"China has a huge population — 1.4 billion people, and 99 percent of crypto projects there just don't have the proper technologies to keep themselves on the right track, so the government can't allow good and evil people mixed up,\" said Ling. \"But it's just temporary. China is waiting for the right time window and it's indeed a big market.\"\nChina's asset management industry is set to expand five-fold to $17 trillion by 2030, making it the second-largest market in the world, up from $2.8 trillion in 2016, according to a report by asset management strategy consultancy Casey Quirk, a practice of Deloitte.\nAnd that would be a pie everyone wants to grab a piece of.\n\"It's like the internet, Wechat and mobile payment,\" said Ling. \"It's just a matter of timing. When the timing is right, China will be okay with the technology and that's when we will launch (BB Index) there.\"\n"}

So it fell upon the United States to become a provider or exporter of international capital to the global economy; next, to become a consumer or importer of goods and services produced by the global economy; and finally, to provide a currency that could serve as a safe and liquid asset in which the global economy's excess savings could be stored.\n\"China is already the biggest contributor to global growth and among the biggest capital exporters in the international system,\" Gupta said. \"As it liberalizes and becomes a more consumption-centered economy, it is also gradually becoming a key consumption pole -- not just a growth pole -- within the global economy.\"\nHowever, he noted that the Chinese yuan is still some way off from becoming a true \"safe haven\" currency. \"China needs to tackle its banking and financial sector leverage problems energetically and continue moving on a liberalizing track,\" he said.\nThe BFA would be an excellent place for China to reiterate its commitment to open multilateralism, which Chinese President Xi Jinping had championed in Davos and Geneva last year, Gupta said.\nHe said it would also be an excellent place for China to lay out a co-leadership role with the EU to deepen trade and investment reform within the global economy, as well as to highlight the important economic and administrative restructuring decisions taken during China's \"two sessions\" -- the annual sessions of the National People's Congress, the national legislature, and the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, a political advisory body.\nThe BFA will be held in Boao, a coastal town in China's southern island province of Hainan, on April 8-11.

Each side will hold half of the fund's stock rights to manage it as a mixed-ownership fund, said the report.\nThe move came after the central government announced earlier this month that it had selected a group of 31 SOEs, under local authorities or the central government, for the third round of SOE mixed ownership reform, aiming to bring more private capital into the State sector. Li Jin, chief researcher at the China Enterprise Research Institute, said the government's next move will be to further promote mixed-ownership reform at local SOEs.\nMixed-ownership reform is designed to further diversify the ownership structure of SOEs, going beyond mergers, acquisitions and reorganization, and has helped improve the efficiency and competitiveness of SOEs directly under the central government.\n\"As local SOEs face more competition between each As the reform will take place soon, a number of funds backed by State capital have also appeared to support the project across the country.\nThe China Structural Reform Fund led by State-owned capital joined forces with Industrial and Commercial Bank of China Beijing branch and Beijing Wealth Capital to establish a special fund in August. It aims to invest in mixed-ownership reform and the restructuring of central and local government-controlled enterprises.\nA similar fund was set up by Yangquan Coal Industry (Group) Co and Beijing-based Phoenix Tree Capital Partners, which jointly launched a 10 billion yuan mixed-ownership reform fund in Taiyuan earlier this month, the first in northern China's Shanxi province, while such funds have also appeared in Beijing, Shenzhen, Shanghai and Guangzhou.\nWang Wen, executive dean of the Chongyang Institute for Financial Studies at Renmin University of China, said these specific funds are vital to expand capital investment and could best use market forces to inject vigor into the new round of SOE reform.\n\"The fund will promote an overhaul of SOEs, pilot mixed ownership programs, encourage mergers and acquisitions, and downsize overstaffed companies,\" he said.\n\"Like central SOEs, local SOEs should also set up a modern company system during the reform process,\" said Zhu Houlin, a business partner at Beijing-based Zhongjin Guoxu Asset Management Co.\nZhu said the management mechanisms of local SOEs may not be as sophisticated as those of centrally administered ones.\nThe first two rounds of reform covered 19 SOEs, including China State Shipbuilding Corp and China Unicom.

China’s regulators are trying to slow the pace of overseas takeovers, potentially bringing an element of horror to billionaire Wang Jianlin’s Hollywood dream.\nWanda is a real-estate group that’s seeking to transform itself into a entertainment giant that would challenge\nWalt Disney Co. Born in 1954, Wang served in the People’s Liberation Army from 1970 to 1986 and founded Wanda a few years later. Wang’s companies include Hong Kong-listed Wanda Hotel Development Co., Shenzhen-listed Wanda Film Holding Co. and New York-listed AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc. Despite the property roots, Wang is squarely focused on entertainment and has said numerous times that he’d be willing to buy a big Hollywood studio.\nIt’s the world’s largest operator of movie theaters. Wanda\ntook control of AMC in a $2.6 billion deal in 2012 then through AMC acquired other movie theaters including Odeon & UCI Cinemas,\nCarmike Cinemas Inc. and Nordic Cinema Group Holding AB. Last year, Wanda became the first Chinese firm to own a Hollywood film production company when it paid $3.5 billion for\nLegendary Entertainment, maker of movies like “Kong: Skull Island” and “Straight Outta Compton.” Wang, who’s talked of buying stakes in Lionsgate and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, wants to control 20 percent of the global film market by 2020.\n“The Great Wall,” a Wanda-backed movie starring Matt Damon, was shot at Wanda’s Qingdao Movie Metropolis, the world’s biggest film lot. (Nicole Kidman, Leonardo DiCaprio and Catherine Zeta-Jones were among the stars who attended the 2013\nopening ceremony of the Qingdao studio.) With a production budget of $150 million, “The Great Wall” was the costliest Chinese-American co-production ever but\nflopped at the U.S. box office this year. A plan for Wanda Film to buy movie-making assets including Legendary from the parent group for 37.2 billion yuan ($5.6 billion) collapsed last year.\nThe group owns Infront Sports & Media AG, a sports marketing company, and Ironman organizer World Triathlon Corp. It also has a stake in Club Atletico de Madrid and is a top sponsor of soccer’s ruling body FIFA.\nChina wants to cut outflows of capital that are heaping pressure on the yuan. That’s led the government to target Wanda and other acquisitive conglomerates including\nFosun International Ltd.,\nHNA Group Co. and\nAnbang Insurance Group Co. China will cut off some funding and take other steps to punish Wanda for breaching restrictions on overseas investments, including the January deal to buy\nNordic Cinema Group for 8.25 billion Swedish kronor ($1 billion), people familiar with the matter have said. It wasn’t immediately clear which investment rules Wanda had breached. Wang has announced more than $20 billion of deals since the beginning of 2016.\nThe Chinese currency had been depreciating fast when in December it came within striking distance of crossing 7 to the dollar for the first time since 2008. Back in early 2014, the yuan was close to 6. Chinese officials worry that money flowing out for overseas purchases will exacerbate the currency’s depreciation, which in turn will spur a selloff in the yuan. A Communist Party body chaired by President Xi Jinping on June 26 called for greater scrutiny of outbound investments, according to Xinhua. This and other strategies to curb\ncapital outflows may be working: the yuan has strengthened against the dollar in 2017.\nYes. Although Wanda has not commented on the reports of punitive measures, the increased scrutiny on overseas deals contributed to the collapse of a proposed $1 billion acquisition of\nDick Clark Productions Inc., producer of the Golden Globes Awards and TV shows such as “So You Think You Can Dance,” early this year. AMC’s shares\nhave plunged more than 40 percent in 2017.\nIt already has started, with the sale of hotels and theme parks. In July, Wanda agreed to sell most of it hotels to Guangzhou R&F Properties Co. for 19.9 billion yuan. Wanda also agreed to sell a 91 percent stake in its tourism projects to Chinese developer\nSunac China Holdings Ltd. for 43.8 billion yuan. The latter deal represented a departure from Wang’s past predictions that he would build a tourism empire bigger than that of Walt Disney.\n"}

[Photo provided to China Daily]\nPrivate hospitals backed by foreign investors will supplement China's existing healthcare system by offering more complicated surgical operations and high-quality medical services, as well as further enriching the ways foreign direct investment gets used in the country.\nThe number of private hospitals in China surpassed 17,000 in the first half of this year, accounting for 57.5 percent of the total across the country, according to the National Health and Family Planning Commission.\nShanghai-based Delta-Health, funded by Eight Roads Ventures, is one such private hospital. It is marking its first anniversary in China by showcasing its experience in the private sector.\nIts experience suggests private hospitals have a lot of potential to function as an alternative option for both patients and medical workers in a market that is still dominated by public hospitals.\nFor David Hoidal, chief operating officer of Delta Health, the core competitiveness of private hospitals lays in their advanced equipment, competitive salaries for professionals, attractive career growth and full-cycle services for patients.\n\"As an important partner of Columbia HeartSource in China, we can offer a chance for doctors and nurses to know about cutting-edge medical discoveries, gain world-class experience and deep knowledge from around the world,\" said Hoidal.\n\"I think a pure environment for doctors to learn and develop is very crucial for them,\" said Desmond Thio, chief executive officer of DeltaHealth. \"Within a private environment, they can just do what they need to do without further worries about their livelihood.\"\nFor patients, private hospitals provide complete aftercare after surgery, Hoidal said.\nInstead of being hostile to each other, private and public hospitals should efficiently work together and form a healthy collaborative relationship, he said.\n\"In the past, we've hosted academic seminars, forums with established doctors while also inviting public hospitals to join us,\" said Hoidal. \"I believe in the future, when the private sector gradually grows in size, public hospitals will also show interest in how their private peers function.\"\nLast year, the Chinese government released \"Healthy China 2030\", a blueprint that covers areas such as public health services, the medical industry, and food and drug safety, with the aim of improving the health of the Chinese people.\nThio thinks the future is bright for private hospitals in China. \"This is a massive country, and Shanghai is fairly big with a population of over 26 million.

What impact will its foreign policies have? [Special coverage]\nChina has set out a vision for its diplomacy in the new era. The country is set to contribute to reforming the global governance system, as well as world peace and development.\nChinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi said: \"2017, both for the world and China, was a year of symbolic significance. This year, the international situation continues to undergo profound changes and adjustments. Our world is once again at a critical juncture. Is it open or closed, progressive or conservative, rational or extreme? It's about the future and the destiny of mankind.

But after going through the company's processing machine, the shells are turned from food waste to chitosan fiber, basically indistinguishable from other synthetic fibers.\n\"The biomass fiber can wean textile companies' off their reliance on crude oil,\" said Hu Guangmin, Hismer's chair.\nHu said Hismer collects 10,000 metric tons of the shell waste from seafood processing companies in China's ports of Qingdao, Yantai, Dalian and Ningbo a year for the production of some 6,000 tons of biomass fiber. It has become the world's largest marine renewable producer.\nThe fibre is then used by a variety of garment producers. When fashion lovers buy a stylish anti-bacterial underwear from lingerie producer Embry Form, they could hardly link it to shrimp and crab shells.\nThe fabric is not only used for making socks, underwear, bedding but also medical products such as masks and sanitary pads as well as special cloth used in aerospace planes, Hu said.\nHe said innovation has saved the textile company from going bankrupt. The factory had trouble in business due to rising cost at home and stagnant export market. Hu said the company of 800 employees had to lay off some 200 people when the business was bad.\nFive years ago, the textile producer placed its bet on developing the production technology and equipment for making the biomass material.\nHu said Hismer has set up production cooperation with 70 companies including Toyota and German firms of Freudenberg and Medovent for developing fabric products for medical use. It also makes product development in partnership with Taiwan-based tech firm BenQ and Hong Kong-based lingerie producer Embry Form.\nHu said in the past, there were 500 workers in its yarn spinning workshop. However, the current production only requires 75 workers, as most processing is done by automated equipment.\nThe company has developed materials used in China's \"Shenzhou\" manned spacecraft and \"Tiangong\" space lab, as they are mildew-proof and resistant to fire, static electricity and odor.\nHismer is not the only company introducing innovation to China's textile industry. BMSG, a bio seaweed substance processing firm, has been turning seaweed into biomass fibers for cloth that can be safely used for surgical dressings.\n\"A ton of seaweed can be bought for just 8,000 yuan ($1,207). However, after turning into fabric sodium alginate, it is 80,000 yuan per ton. If further processed into surgical dressing, it is worth 2.4 million yuan,\" said Xu Yuqiang, secretary of the board of the BMSG, based in Qingdao, Shandong province.\nJiang Shicheng, a member of Chinese Academy of Engineering, said that the development of biomass textile materials is still at an initial stage, but it is the future of textiles. Only when a new material industrial cluster has taken shape, can it bring vitality to the overall industry, Jiang added.\nSun Ruizhe, director of the China National Textile and Apparel Council, was also positive about the future of biomass materials, saying that green textile products have become the new trend in the textile industry. Textile producers should develop environmentally friendly textile materials and make the whole production process pollution free, he said .\n"}

[Photo/Xinhua]\nHainan Airlines flight to Chicago uses biofuel made by Sinopec unit\nChina conducted the nation's first cross-ocean flight powered by green aviation fuel on Tuesday, carrying 186 passengers and 15 crew members. The successful flight signals another significant breakthrough for domestic biofuel.\nThe Hainan Airlines flight from Beijing landed at Chicago's O'Hare International Airport on Tuesday, after flying 11 hours and 41 minutes, for a distance of 11,297 kilometers. The Boeing 787 aircraft flew with biofuel produced from waste cooking oil by China Petroleum and Chemical Corp.\nThe aviation kerosene made from restaurants' waste edible oil was produced at Zhenhai Refining and Chemical Co, a subsidiary of Sinopec based in Ningbo, Zhejiang province, and the biofuel is a mix of 15 percent of cooking oil and 85 percent of conventional aviation fuel.\n\"The biofuel developed by Sinopec is of great significance to people's health as well as environmental protection,\" said Han Xiaoping, chief information officer of China Energy Net Consulting Co.\n\"The biofuel has high quality, thanks to Sinopec's sophisticated technology in the sector. Flights need large amounts of high-quality fuel, which requires fuel manufacturers to add additives to make sure that it will not freeze during low temperatures,\" he said.\n\"The country needs to offer tax exemptions and subsidies in the aviation-grade biofuel sector to support its development,\" Han said, adding that related laws and regulations should be established to ensure restaurants' waste kitchen oil will not return to family dining tables.\nXu Chaoqun, head of the airworthiness certification department at the Civil Aviation Administration of China, said the use of biofuel is an important development in the global aviation fuel market.\n\"It's critical to develop green alternative energy, and push forward the R&D and application of biofuel with independent intellectual property rights. The biofuel developed by Sinopec is the first such aviation fuel that has been approved by the CAAC.\"\nSinopec said jet fuel made from restaurants' waste kitchen oil will help to reduce carbon dioxide emissions and make better use of the waste.\nSinopec spokesman Lyu Dapeng said aviation biofuel had met stringent safety standards, and Sinopec will speed up the commercial application of the biofuel with the support of related parties.\nBiofuel usually refers to aviation fuel that is produced from renewable resources, including vegetable oils such as coconut oil, palm oil, jatropha oil and linseed oil, in addition to microalgae oil, waste cooking oil and animal fat. Compared with traditional petroleum-based aviation fuel, biofuel can help to reduce over 50 percent of carbon dioxide.\n"}

And so much of that is about the graphic design, absolutely.

So, that wall we have of magazine covers, were illustrators, with incredible brevity, still manage to convey a lot, is because he is so identifiable, his hair, his tie, and his jacket. You know, any of those components now, singularly, would still say Trump.\"\nThe exhibit also features numerous graphic works made by supposed amateurs.\nThere's protest banners from women's marches in the United States and leaflets from London's Occupy movement.\nCubbage says it shows how graphic design has the power to reach out and empower people.\n\"These images can have the ability to really reach out and connect with other people and create communities,\" she says.\n\"We wanted to empower people with that message and show that graphic design has a place to really communicate and bring together people.\"\n'Hope to Nope: Graphics and Politics 2008-18' runs 28 March - 12 August 2018 at London's Design Museum.\nShare this article\nworld news\nCult\nAdventures\nAdventures\nworld news\nView\nView\nworld news\nCult\nCult\nCult\nCult\nCult\nCult\nCult\nCult\nCult\nCult\nCult\n\n"}

Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying told reporters she had noted recent media reports including suggestions a Chinese vessel was suspected of transporting oil to a North Korean vessel on Oct. 19.\n\"The Chinese side has conducted immediate investigation. In reality, the ship in question has, since August, not docked at a Chinese port and there is no record of it entering or leaving a Chinese port,\" Hua said.\nShe said she was not aware if the vessel had docked at the port in other countries but the relevant media reports \"did not accord with facts\".\n\"China has always implemented U.N. Security Council resolutions pertaining to North Korea in their entirety and fulfills its international obligations. We never allow Chinese companies and citizens to violate the resolutions,\" Hua said.\n\"If, through investigation, it's confirmed there are violations of the U.N. Security Council resolutions, China will deal with them seriously in accordance with laws and regulations.\"\nIn the New York Times interview, Trump explicitly tied his administration's trade policy with China to its perceived cooperation in resolving the North Korea nuclear crisis.\n\"When I campaigned, I was very tough on China in terms of trade. They made - last year, we had a trade deficit with China of $350 billion, minimum. That doesn't include the theft of intellectual property, O.K., which is another $300 billion,\" Trump said, according to a transcript of the interview.\n\"If they're helping me with North Korea, I can look at trade a little bit differently, at least for a period of time. And that's what I've been doing. But when oil is going in, I'm not happy about that.\"\nAn official of the U.S. State Department said the U.S. government was aware of vessels engaged in such activity involving refined petroleum and coal.\n\"We have evidence that some of the vessels engaged in these activities are owned by companies in several countries, including China,\" the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity.\nThe United States says the full cooperation of China, North Korea's neighbour and main trading partner, is vital to the success of efforts to rein in North Korea, while warning that all options are on the table, including military ones, in dealing with it.\nChina has repeatedly said it is fully enforcing all resolutions against North Korea, despite suspicion in Washington, Seoul and Tokyo that loopholes still exist.\nSouth Korea said on Friday it had seized a Hong Kong-flagged ship suspected of transferring oil to North Korea in defiance of the sanctions.\nA senior South Korean foreign ministry official said the ship, the Lighthouse Winmore, was seized when it arrived at a South Korean port in late November.\n\"It's unclear how much oil the ship had transferred to North Korea for how long and on how many occasions, but it clearly showed North Korea is engaged in evading the sanctions,\" the official told Reuters.\nSouth Korea said it had obtained intelligence showing the Hong Kong-flagged Lighthouse Winmore transferring as much as 600 tons of refined petroleum products to a North Korea-flagged ship, the Sam Jong 2, on Oct. 19 in international waters between China and the Korean peninsula.\nEmployees at the office of Lighthouse Ship Management, the ship's registered manager, in the Chinese port city of Guangzhou, declined to comment and said they had no knowledge of the situation.\nChina's foreign ministry spokeswoman said she did not have any information about the matter.\nBoth ships were among 10 vessels that the United States had proposed that the U.N. Security Council should blacklist for transporting banned items from North Korea, documents seen by Reuters this month showed.\nChina and Russia subsequently asked for more time to consider the U.S. proposal. Ship tracking data in Thomson Reuters Eikon shows that the Lighthouse Winmore has mainly been doing supply runs between China and Taiwan since August.\n\nPrior to that, it was active between India and the United Arab Emirates. In October, when it allegedly transferred petroleum products to a North Korean ship in international waters, the Lighthouse Winmore had its tracking transponder switched off.\nThe Trump administration has led a drive to step up global sanctions on North Korea in response to its efforts to develop nuclear-tipped missiles capable of hitting the United States.\nThe U.N. Security Council last week unanimously imposed new sanctions on North Korea for a recent intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) test, seeking to further limit its access to refined petroleum products and crude oil.\n\nThe U.S.-drafted U.N. resolution seeks to ban nearly 90 percent of refined petroleum exports to North Korea by capping them at 500,000 barrels a year.\nIt also caps crude oil supplies to North Korea at 4 million barrels a year and commits the Security Council to further reductions if Pyongyang conducts another nuclear or ICBM test.\nBeside the Lighthouse Winmore and the Sam Jong 2, the ships targeted for blacklisting were the Xin Sheng Hai (flag unknown); the Togo-flagged Yu Yuan; Panama-flagged Glory Hope 1 (also known as Orient Shenyu), Kai Xiang and Billions No. 18; and the North Korean-flagged Ul Ji Bong 6, Rung Ra 2, and Rye Song Gang 1.\nIn September, the Security Council put a cap of 2 million barrels a year on refined petroleum products exports to North Korea.\n\nPlaying\nShare this video...\nWatch Next...\n"}

The company has plans to sell some $1.5 billion in hotel assets in the next three years, according to travel industry site Skift.\nWhen asked whether the absence of Chinese buyers was potentially suppressing the value of hotels Hyatt might want to sell, Hoplamazian said the market remained \"buoyant and actually, healthy\" due to the interest rate environment.\n\"My expectation is that the fact that there's been a change in the incidence of investment outside of China for Chinese companies will probably have an impact on selected assets and selected markets, but I don't think it'll have a broader impact than that,\" he added.\nWhile Chinese companies have snapped up multiple hotel assets in recent years, a firmer yuan this year and tighter regulations have had an impact on capital moving out of the country.\nLimits on overseas investments implemented by authorities came after several high-profile acquisitions by Chinese corporates in recent years. Anbang Insurance Group, a holding company that was among the most acquisitive in China, bought the iconic Waldorf Astoria hotel in New York for $2 billion in 2014.

Advances in robotics and artificial intelligence will not change this\nComments:\n\nSpring is the season of big meetings – Davos, Boao and, coming this weekend, the Spring Meetings of the IMF/World Bank in Washington. Here, the Davos men (and increasingly women) gather with the central bankers, ministers of finance, bankers, policy wonks and academics to debate the state of the world. These are often casts of thousands, listening to the latest guru expounding on technology, politics, trade and finance.\nI was at a conference in Italy last week, where the mood was dominated by news of the US-China trade war, better described as the opening skirmishes with more posturing than action. The underlying worry was whether the unfolding war would result in more collateral damage and have a bigger impact on everyone else.\nItaly has just emerged from a confusing election result with no clear consensus about who will form the next government. The Hungarian election results this week showed that, in Europe, far-right populist sentiments are gathering momentum. In France, reformist President Emmanuel Macron is now battling the railway unions to get serious labour reforms going. This is a reminder of how Margaret Thatcher took on the British unions in the early 1980s and won.\nUnfortunately, there are no Thatchers left in the United Kingdom, only the messy aftermath in which a divorcee is left holding a very large bill. One guru gloomily forecast that Britain may soon have its first Marxist prime minister in Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn.\nThe IMF traditionally offers an important World Economic Outlook forecast at the Spring Meetings. This year, the basic outlook is expected to continue the fairly bullish view of a broad-based worldwide recovery with notable upside surprises in Europe and Asia. This week, IMF managing director Christine Lagarde exhorted Asians, who account for almost two-thirds of global growth, to “fix the roof while the sun is shining”.\nBasically, she saw the three big holes in the roof: protectionism, financial/fiscal risks and social inclusivity. In a sense, all three gaping holes are the consequences of policies that failed to address the global financial crises of 2007-09. Protectionism has arisen because advanced countries did not adequately take care of their working and middle classes. Global debt has risen 40 per cent since the crisis, because governments used money to bail out banks or pumped more into welfare and military spending that did not raise productivity. Financial risk is at its highest ever because the lowest-ever interest rates created huge asset bubbles.\nIf you’ve squeeze the wages of the middle class, and then paid zero interest rates on their bank deposits, while house prices become unaffordable, are you surprised when income and wealth inequality worsens?\nLagarde is basically correct that policymakers face a stark choice: either copy the policies of the past or paint a new economic landscape – open fair trade, safer financial systems and digital revolution for all.\nIn Trumpian terms: can you drain the swamp and fix the roof at the same time?\nThe newly published IMF World Economic Outlook asked the question of whether manufacturing will continue to be a jobs creator?\n\nI have argued that East Asian economies are already beginning to use the opportunity of new technology to make an important leap forward in labour productivity and income growth. Moving beyond the middle-income trap means pushing real wages higher so that businesses will invest in higher labour productivity through technology and skills training. The International Federation of Robotics has forecast that, by 2020, there will be 3 million industrial robots operating globally, with 1.9 million in Asia, and China accounting for 950,000.\nAsia’s speed of installation of robotics and artificial intelligence means the door for cheap-labour growth strategy in manufacturing in Africa, Latin America and labour-surplus economies is closing.\nBut why is manufacturing so important for growth strategy?\nThe IMF study argues that, in many countries, manufacturing has faded as a source of jobs, especially in advanced economies. In developing economies, service jobs are starting to replace jobs in manufacturing. This shift to the service sector is an inevitable “structural transformation”.\nThe more important question is whether an emerging market can leapfrog into the higher-earning services sector, skipping the manufacturing phase. The East Asian experience suggests otherwise.\nOne tends to forget that both Hong Kong and Singapore were initially manufacturing centres. As Hong Kong labour became more expensive, the shifting of manufacturing across the border to southern China was mutually beneficial. Today, the Chinese economy is building on its manufacturing prowess towards more value-added services. India, without that supply chain advantage, finds the transition much harder.\nWhy is the Trump administration so concerned about onshoring of manufacturing in America? The answer is that, when you focus exclusively on services, you lose manufacturing skills critical for the prototyping of new products and services. This explains why Shenzhen has become the prototype centre of the world, with some of the best manufacturing craftsmen and engineers, who can take an idea and turn it into reality.\nThe Chinese philosopher Wang Yangming concluded that “knowledge and action are one”, meaning that knowledge on paper is useless on its own. It has only value through practice.\nWe should therefore be sceptical of the view that it may be possible for some economies to bypass the traditional industrialisation phase for the services area. You can never run before you can walk.\nOnly economists can fix roofs without building a ladder.\nAndrew Sheng writes on global issues from an Asian perspective\nYou are signed up.

(York, PA) has installed the first Graham rotary wheel extrusion blow molding system for use in mainland China. The Mega 26 dual-parison system production line was commissioned last month at the Guangzhou facility of a converter for a leading U.S.-based global consumer packaged goods (CPG) brand.\n“For decades we have served the world’s leading converters and CPGs with our flagship Graham rotary extrusion blow molding solutions,” says Graham CEO David Schroeder. “While we have sold rotary wheel systems for converters elsewhere in Asia, this project demonstrates the need for rapid evolution, technological advancement, and automation to combat China’s increasing costs, growing regulation, and desire for high quality products for its domestic packaging market.”\nIntroduced to the project by the U.S.-based CPG, the leading brand in its category, the Graham team worked with the company to define the project scope, evaluate production alternatives and build the business case. They ultimately decided to proceed with one of their converters, who committed to a near-site greenfield plant with a fully-automated production line.\nThe volume justified a 26-station, dual-parison, quad-cavity wheel producing 46,800 bottles per hour, replacing twelve locally-manufactured shuttle machines. The line’s speed, capacity, and automation facilitates greater efficiencies in production and in downstream bottle handling. It also enables the brand owner to move away from a stock package to a new bottle design consistent with its global standard.\nCustom details on a custom machine\n“Mega is our largest platform, and our Mega wheel systems are primarily found in very-high volume applications such as single-serve dairy, juice, and motor oil,” Gina Haines, Graham Engineering’s vp and chief marketing officer, tells PlasticsToday. “This system in China produces high volumes of a small, custom, wide-mouth package for the sugar and confectionery segment of the food market.”\nThere are nearly a hundred Mega systems installed fairly equally among CPGs and leading converters worldwide, according to Haines.\nWhere is she seeing the most business activity for Graham’s systems worldwide?\n“The accelerating recovery in capital equipment investment for the packaging market over the past two years continues to generate healthy levels of interest,” Haines responds. “In addition to beverage and food, household, lubricant and medical markets have all generated activity.

The event, which starts early next month, is sometimes dubbed Asia’s Davos and this year will be attended by Chinese President Xi Jinping.\nYi’s political career started as deputy secretary general of a government monetary policy committee in 1997, only three years after he returned from the US to Peking University to co-found the China Centre for Economic Research, now known as the National School of Development. He was then promoted to head of the monetary policy department and foreign exchange regulator.\n\nYi contributed a great deal to smoothing out the country’s monetary policy mechanism and transforming the central bank from a planning agency into a modern central banking regime on a par with the US Federal Reserve, the European Central Bank and the Bank of England, according to Shen Jianguang, chief economist at Mizuho Securities Asia.\n“The central bank has also achieved big progress in forward looking policy and expectation management with his help,” he said.\nSun Lijian, a professor at Fudan University in Shanghai, said the appointment sent a strong signal that Beijing wanted to see China taking a bigger role in global finance.\n“It breaks a tacit rule in China that a person with overseas experiences shouldn’t be appointed as the number one official in a key government division,” he said. “Yi will be a good successor to Zhou in many aspects, including making the yuan a truly international currency.”\nYi is fluent in English and received a doctorate in economics from the University of Illinois and taught the same subject at Indiana University. Given his familiarity with international financial and monetary policymakers, he was frequently present at international conventions to communicate China’s financial policies.\n\nWhen the impact of the stock market rout and the sudden depreciation of the yuan rippled through overseas markets in 2015, Yi as deputy central bank governor and head of the State Administration of Foreign Exchange, took the tough job of easing foreign concerns.\n“Don’t worry, China still has pretty much middle to high growth in the near future,” he told hundreds of delegates at an International Monetary Fund-World Bank seminar in Peru that year.\nLiu He: China’s new one-man debt bomb disposal unit\nGary Liu, president of China Financial Reform Institute, a Shanghai-based research group, said that while Yi undoubtedly had a deep financial knowledge, his frontline management abilities had yet to be tested.\n“He needs more action … to prove [his capability],” he said.\nYi will work closely with Liu He – the vice-premier in charge of financial and economic affairs, and Xi’s most trusted economic adviser – with whom he had worked on the central leading group for financial and economic affairs since 2014.\nAfter the Financial Stability and Development Commission was set up in July to oversee regulatory efforts, Beijing last week merged the country’s banking and insurance regulators to further improve market supervision.\nChina confirms anti-graft official’s position on military’s ruling body as war on corruption heats up\nAs a result, the central bank was given more power to set monetary policy and market rules, although Yi will not have things all his own way, according to one analyst.\nLarry Hu, chief China economist at Macquarie Securities, said the People’s Bank of China lacked the freedom enjoyed by many of its counterparts around the world and that Yi would face many challenges.\n“It [the PBOC] acts more like an adviser and operator, but not a maker, of monetary policy,” he said, adding that running it was “not an easy job”.\nAdditional reporting by Wendy Wu\nYou are signed up.

But today, his company in South China's Guzhen township, dubbed \"China Lighting Capital,\" works with several Italian lighting designers.\nDing started his first company in the manufacturing hub on the Pearl River Delta in 2007. Its copycat lights, sold at home and abroad, brought in more than 20 million yuan ($3 million) in the first year. In 2008, he was sued by the Italian company and lost the lawsuit in 2010, when his company went bankrupt.\nIn 2014, Ding founded the lighting brand MUMOON focusing on original designs. The change in business plan was not only due to learning a lesson from his previous company. It was also due to changes to the local intellectual property rights (IPR) environment after an IPR protection center was set up in 2011 by the local government under the authorization of the State Intellectual Property Office.\n\"Foreign lighting companies used to call us plagiarizers. Now, they are willing and confident to maintain long-term cooperation with us,\" Ding said.\nFollowing more than 30 years of development, the small town has become the world's largest light manufacturing and sales center. Last year, Guzhen manufactured around 50 percent of lights sold worldwide, exporting products worth $370 million.\nHowever, before the IPR protection center was established, the local lighting industry was dominated by cheap and inferior counterfeits.\nDesigners did not like to work with Guzhen's manufacturers because of their copycat products, said Zhou Jintian with the town's Communist Party of China committee.\n\"We used to only allow VIP customers or buyers with reliable recommendations to see our new designs in the back room,\" said Zhang Zhuanli, general manager of Guzhen-based Kinglong Lighting Co Ltd.\nRampant IPR infringement resulted from the red tape involved in patent applications. It took the local intellectual property office a year to approve a patent, while each model would be replaced by a new one every three months, making patent application meaningless.\nThe IPR protection center has shortened the processing time to seven days, which has boosted enthusiasm for innovation and raised IPR awareness.\nIn 2016, the center handled more than 9,000 patent applications, up nearly 30 percent year-on-year, and over 500 IPR disputes, up nearly 24 percent.\nMa Chi, a teacher at Zhongshan Polytechnic, started a lighting studio with his students in Guzhen, earning more than 200,000 yuan a year selling patents and designs to companies.\n\"In the past, we sold lighting products, now we're selling designs and it makes good money,\" Ma said.\nMost Guzhen's lighting companies now have their own design teams and brands, creating many new styles of lighting, said Ou Enxiong, deputy director of the town's bureau of economy, technology and information.\nAs better IPR protection has evolved Guzhen into a leading innovator in the global lighting industry, the IPR protection center has started to deal with disputes in which foreign companies have copied Chinese products, said Zhang Binghui, deputy head of the center.\nGuzhen's transformation epitomizes China's increasing efforts in IPR protection.\nIn response to a memorandum signed by US President Donald Trump to direct the US Trade Representative to examine China's intellectual property practices, a spokesperson with the Ministry of Commerce said earlier this week that China has always paid great attention to IPR protection, by improving legislation and intensifying administrative and judicial protection.\nIn 2016, Chinese police solved 17,000 criminal cases of IPR infringement, with more than 4.6 billion yuan involved, and Chinese customs seized over 42 million products violating IPR.\nSince 2013, the Chinese government has launched over 170 campaigns to prevent fake products, while more than 1.3 million cases have been handled and nearly 100,000 people jailed. The intellectual property courts set up in Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou in 2014 have dealt with nearly 40,000 cases.\n"}

It is a situation which is unlikely to last for long.\nEurope’s elite nations may be enjoying the best of the post-crisis recovery, but its distressed and poorer states still remain badly disadvantaged.\nAngela Merkel hits out at Donald Trump as she warns Davos against ‘populist poison’ of protectionism\nSlower growth, weaker productivity, stubbornly high unemployment and deep-rooted structural problems are condemning Europe’s weaker economies to lag further behind, unless they get a better deal on investment and resources heading their way. Europe needs a level playing field for the future.\nThe trouble is Europe is dictated too much on German terms.\nEuro zone monetary policy is being reined in to suit German whims. Germany is demanding even tougher European budget consolidation to forge closer economic ties.\n\nYet it still stonewalls the full fiscal union which might remedy European inequality at a stroke. Germany wants its cake and to eat it too.\nIt may be fine while the European Central Bank practices its monetary magic and maintains the illusion of synchronised recovery in the euro zone.\nBut it will soon be back to square one with weaker nations looking askance at Germany’s relative fortunes when the ECB’s cheap money flows dry up later this year. Tensions will come back to the boil as countries fall behind again in the relative growth stakes.\nGermany is enjoying unparalleled economic success. Solid GDP growth, low unemployment, a burgeoning budget balance, a rampant trade surplus and Germany’s all-conquering industrial might are rubbing salt into the wounds of its weaker partners.\nGermany’s economic dominance is causing deep political ructions and needs to change tack to share out more of its spoils.\nGovernments can ill-afford to ignore the seismic changes occurring throughout Europe right now. The recent election results in Italy are a reminder to Europe’s ruling parties that political discontent is riding high.\n\nPolitical populism is still bubbling up, especially among Europe’s young, unemployed and disadvantaged. Public anger is being heaped on the old order and change is long overdue.\nEurope must raise its game and improve on its dismal GDP growth track record over the last 20 years of only 1 per cent per annum. The best plan of attack would be to reinforce self-sustaining growth for all European countries.\nDisposable incomes, spending power and better wealth distribution must be improved and brought closer into line with Germany and the more prosperous EU nations.\nIt is pointless Germany selfishly dominating its captive market in Europe, exporting top-end, luxury BMWs, Mercedes and Porches into cash-strapped, ailing European countries which only end up with yawning trade gaps and increasing piles of unpayable debt.\nIn the absence of better trade reciprocity, Europe needs massive intervention to stop the imbalances going beyond repair.\nThe glaring failure of the EU is the widening divide between rich and poor nations. Where this is most acute are the huge employment differences facing many young Europeans.\nFor the under-25s, the jobless rate is over 40 per cent in Greece, yet as low as 7 per cent in Germany. This is not sustainable in the long term. It is a breeding ground for ill-feeling and deepening political rifts.\nEurope’s leaders need to get their thinking caps on quick. By all accounts, German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Emmanuel Macron are postponing plans to announce major new initiatives at the European leaders’ summit later this month.\nBut the longer Brussels delays introducing much needed structural reforms, it simply ends up kicking the can down the road.\nIt is not closer political integration which is needed but new mechanisms to help mobilise prosperity and productive capacity towards Europe’s ailing and failing economies. Closer economic integration is imperative with fuller fiscal union and a single European budget to focus cross-border tax and spending flows where they are needed most.\nGermany might not like it, but it must happen sooner rather than later.\nThe clock is ticking and Europe’s leaders must move fast to head off the existential crisis which is looming down the road.\nYou are signed up.

Its $522.8 billion market valuation is chasing just behind Amazon and has overtaken Facebook to rank fifth in an elite club of the world's top six businesses to have reached the market cap milestone of $500 billion.\nFirst listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange in 2004, the 19-year-old company's shares have more than doubled in price this year, putting the benchmark Hang Seng Index on course to become the world's best performing gauge.\nBolstered by Tencent's rally on Tuesday, the Hang Seng extended its winning streak to a third straight session, up by 1.9 percent, or 557.8 points, to close at a 10-year high of 29,818.1 points after crossing the 29,000-point threshold on Friday.\n\"With more than twice the share price this year and a market capitalization of over $500 billion, Tencent stands as an 'anchor' of the Hang Seng Index,\" said Fielding Chen Shiyuan, Hong Kong-based Asia economist at Bloomberg Intelligence. \"The market just wonders how far it will go to hit another new record high, and how much further gains the Hang Seng Index is set for on the back of such a tech behemoth.\"\nThe meteoric rise of Tencent's share price was buoyed by its new mobile game, Glorious Mission, one of the country's two survival games. It was made available to a section of the public for testing on Tuesday, with more than 30 million pre-registrations.\nThe new game is expected to take the baton from top-grossing mobile game King of Glory, also known as Honor of Kings, to become the next growth engine for the social-media and gaming giant.\n"}

[Photo/VCG]\nChina's moves to expand foreign companies' investment options will accelerate the upgrade of the country's economic structure and encourage many domestic businesses to deepen reform and break their monopoly operation, experts said on Thursday.\nThose moves include allowing global companies to establish new business through mergers and acquisitions of domestic firms and ensuring that foreign companies can send their profit back to either their home countries or other global markets any time they want, as well as encouraging them to participate in the ongoing mixed-ownership of State-owned enterprises, according to a document released by the State Council on Wednesday.\n\"Even though China does not lack capital, it is necessary to boost inbound flows of foreign capital, pushed by upgrading industrial structure, demand for advanced technologies and global resource allocation,\" said He Manqing, director of the Foreign Investment Research Institute of the Beijing-based Chinese Academy of International Trade and Economic Cooperation.\nAlexandra Voss, chief representative of the Delegation of German Industry and Commerce in Beijing, said in a statement: \"We now hope concrete policies will arise from this position and will be implemented as soon as possible to further improve the business environment for foreign investors and ensure equal treatment for all companies operating in China.\"\nEager to restore its ability to gain foreign direct investment, China will also make a clear timetable and guidelines to gradually open businesses including new-energy vehicle manufacturing, vessel design, railway passenger service, regional and regular aircraft maintenance, gas stations, call centers, entertainment, banking, insurance and securities businesses to foreign investors.\nSang Baichuan, director of the Institute of International Business at the University of International Business and Economics in Beijing, said with costs rising, China needs to think out of box to further open up and attract foreign investment to help domestic growth and support globalization.\nForeign companies have not only sent capital to China, they also brought advanced management experience, technologies, sales strategies and third party markets to the country. An unstable FDI volume certainly will put pressure on China's economic growth.\nForeign companies had invested $1.6 trillion and established more than 830,000 enterprises in China since 1983, data from the Ministry of Commerce show.\nZhang Yansheng, chief economist at the China Center for International Economic Exchanges, said China has always been implementing favorable policies and it will further enhance its appeal to foreign investors, thereby combating the decline in advantages China used to have and the fierce competition for foreign investment from other countries.\nZhang doesn't agree with some voices saying foreign investment has reached a peak in China. He said if China signs bilateral investment treaties with the United States and European Union sooner or later, there will be a promising increase in foreign investment just as when it joined WTO years back.\nHuo Jianguo, vice-president of the China Institute for WTO Studies, warned that more opening means more risk and poses bigger challenge on the country's risk management capability. That will test both the government policy-making abilities and domestic companies' capability in adapting new market environment.\nEnvironment easier for global firms\nGUANGZHOUï¼China's business environment is becoming easier to navigate for international corporations entering the market.\nLyle Charles Laxton, CEO of South Africa-based Laxton Group, moved the company's technology and production headquarters to Guangzhou in South China's Guangdong province.\nThe South African entrepreneur made the decision because it was clear the Chinese government was opening the market and making it easier for global companies to invest and establish businesses in China.\n\"The opportunities in China are endless and the market is exceptionally large,\" Laxton said. \"It is possible to be very successful in China. But patience is required to understand the nuances of the environment and market.\n\"The legal framework and judicial system is fair and actually works,\" he added. \"In general, it has protected us when we required protection, which is encouraging for any foreign investor.\"\nFounded in 2004 in Johannesburg, Laxton moved its technology and production headquarters to Guangzhou in 2009, where its factory has 200 permanent employees.\nThe multinational group specializes in manufacturing self-service kiosk terminals for governments and corporations.\nLast year, the company obtained a high-tech firm certificate from the Guangdong provincial government.\nXINHUA\n"}

Coolqi, with 1.4 million shared bikes, went bankrupt November in a suspected capital chain break, and Bluegogo, with 830,000 bikes, closed the same month due to suspected financing failure.\nThe headquarters of Bluegogo in Beijing is near-empty.\nLi Wensheng, father of Bluegogo founder Li Gang, Thursday met with bike suppliers and investors, admitting the company's incompetence in drawing financing to sustain its capital chain.\nNo party has claimed responsibility for refunding public deposits.\nIn addition to the bike users, Bluegogo employees disclosed on social media that the company might be unable to pay employee salaries.\nDebtors have queued in front of Coolqi's headquarters in the Tongzhou District of Beijing, asking for the return of deposits.\nThe company announced Sunday that it has entrusted a company in Chengdu, capital of southwest China's Sichuan Province, to deal with refunds.\nXinhua reporters tried to call the company's three service hotlines, but lines appeared busy.\nGao Weiwei, former CEO of Coolqi, said the 650 yuan ($98) cost of a bike was enough to cover a user deposit of 298 yuan.\n\"In the worst scenario, we will allow debtors to ride our bikes home,\" he said.\nChina's bike sharing market is expected to rake in 10.3 billion yuan ($1.5 billion) in revenue this year, a 736-percent increase from 1.2 billion yuan in 2016, according to a report from iiMedia Research.\nIt estimated the number of shared-bike users in China will hit 209 million this year, compared with 28 million last year.\nA report issued by the China Internet Network Information Center in August estimated that users may have paid 10 billion yuan in deposits for using shared bikes.\nFor example, Bluegogo requires a deposit of 200 yuan for using its mobile app to scan the QR codes and unlock its shared bikes\nZhao Zhanling, a lawyer with the Beijing Zhilin Law Firm, told Xinhua that bike sharing firms entrust banks to deal with user deposits.

The WRRC is the professional body for aerobic dancers including Tikhonova.\nMohab told Reuters in the interview that he knew Tikhonova through their work together on the confederation’s presidium.\nWhen asked whether he knew Tikhonova was Putin’s daughter, he said: “Yes. I know her, yes of course.” Asked a second time, he nodded and said: “Yes.”\n\nThe Kremlin and Tikhonova did not respond to Reuters requests for comment.\nAfter the story was published, Mohab phoned Reuters to clarify his statements, saying “I can’t confirm that I know the daughter of Mr. Putin. I have nothing to do with them.”\nAsked why he had earlier said Tikhonova was Putin’s daughter, Mohab said: “Believe me, it was so loud in the hall that a lot of the things I can’t understand and other things I felt that I didn’t understand right. So it’s not sure that I gave you the right answers.”\nThis is the second time that Reuters reported on Tikhonova’s relationship to Putin before being publicly challenged post publication.\nA Russian journalist reported on Tikhonova in 2015\nRussian journalist Oleg Kashin said he had discovered a secret daughter of President Vladimir Putin’s in a 2015 news article titled “She” (or «Она» in Russian). In the article, Kashin wrote he believes that two Russian women who share the same name are actually the same person: Katerina Putin.\nThe article has since been taken down.\nKashin connected an acrobatic dancer by the name of Katerina Tikhonova with a scientist and director of the company “Иннопрактика” by the same name that had been leading the expansion of Moscow State University.\n“The biographic details of the three Katerinas — Putin, Tikhonova-dancer, Tikhonova-scientist ... are all connected into one biography, and yes, it is one woman,” Kashin wrote in his now defunct report.\nThe piece stated the whereabouts of Tikhonova the dancer were uncertain — Kashin reported she was born in 1986 — and the past of Tikhonova the scientist was also cloudy, Kashin wrote.\n\nKashin made the connection between dancer and scientist through the fact that Tikhonova the scientist is also the vice president of Acrobatic Rock ‘N’ Roll.\n“I do not know who that is,” the press spokesman for Vladimir Putin, Dmitry Peskov, said of Tikhonova to Forbes Russia in 2015. “So far, a bunch of girls have come forth as Vladimir Putin’s daughters.”\nKashin also said that Tikhonova the scientist was reportedly named as a plus one of Kirill Shamalov, the son-in-law of the Russian President Vladimir Putin, during an event in Davos.\nKashin wrote: “let’s consider this, just another form of the conspiracy.”\nHere is Tikhonova’s dancing:\nAnd here’s Tikhonova the scientist at the Acrobatic Rock ‘N’ Roll:\n\nSee Also:\nReport reveals new details about Trump’s Oval Office meeting with Russians\nTheresa May warns that ‘hostile’ Russia will tear Europe apart\nMueller is zeroing in on Michael Flynn\nRead the original article at Business Insider\nYou are signed up.

According to the Gallup phone poll of more than 1,000 people in 134 countries, 30 per cent disapproved of the Chinese leadership.\n“This year marks a significant change in our trends,” Gallup managing partner Jon Clifton wrote. This historic low of the approval of the US leadership “puts the US’ leadership approval rating on par with China’s and sets a new bar for disapproval”, he said.\nChinese nationalism is a double-edged sword for global ambitions\nWang Yiwei, director of Renmin University’s Institute of International Affairs, said the confidence among the Chinese respondents to the Edelman survey was partly due to Xi’s campaign to root out corruption, which has reinforced the legitimacy of the one-party rule and allowed Beijing to set its sights on a much bigger global role in shaping the US-led world order.\n“China has the most stable politics among all the big powers, and no other country could have a ‘core leadership’ like Xi Jinping has in China,” Wang said. “China also has similar problems as the West, such as a widening wealth gap, but the government has a consensus when it is dealing with domestic and governance issues.”\nBut Wang said it was too early to jump to the conclusion that the US had failed.\n“[The US] is still capable of taking the lead and its supremacy in the military and global finance remains unchallenged,” he said. “Many people in the US feel distrust towards their government so sometimes they have preconceived notions that their country is failing, which may not be true.”\nAdditional reporting by Reuters\nYou are signed up.

But my favorite is the one I’ve been associated with longest, Brainstorm Tech, our annual gathering of industry movers and shakers in Aspen, Colo. This summer—July 16th to 18th to be exact—will be my 10th year having a hand in overseeing Brainstorm. I love it because in an age of challenged journalism business models, live events are all the rage. They make for an experience that can’t be commoditized and therefore is both great “content”—how I hate that word—and a lucrative business.\nI’m taking the time to tell you this because today we’re announcing our first spate of speakers for Aspen, an exciting collection of executives, entrepreneurs, and investors we know will wow the audience, both in the tent on the grounds of the bucolic Aspen Institute and over the livestream on Fortune.com.\nWhat was called ride-sharing, then ride-hailing, and soon transportation logistics will be a big theme in Aspen, and we’ll have three of the industry’s brightest global stars onstage. Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi will appear for the first time at a Fortune event. John Zimmer, president of Lyft, Uber’s arch foe in the U.S., returns. And Hooi Ling Tan, co-founder of Grab, the Uber of Southeast Asia and also a bitter Uber rival, will appear as well. (Read this great Straits Times interview with her.)\nRetailing is one of the industries most affected by technology. Richard Liu, founder of Chinese e-commerce giant JD.com, is coming to Aspen. JD partners with Walmart, and we’ll have two of its biggest online stars, Marc Lore, head of Walmart’s U.S. digital business, and Jennifer Fleiss, a founder of Rent the Runway and now head of the first portfolio company, Code Eight, a company started by Walmart digital incubator Store No. 8. (Incidentally, a Walmart director, former Yahoo CEO Marissa Mayer, is a co-chair of this year’s event.) And we’re happy to welcome Toni Reid, who leads the product development team behind Amazon’s voice-controlled assistant Alexa as well as its Echo home devices.\nAt Brainstorm we like to discuss the intersection of tech with other industries, including entertainment. Movie producer Stacey Sher, now co-president of Activision Blizzard, will appear, as will Robert Bakish, CEO of Viacom. Design too is a big deal, and Brainstorm will host one of the industry’s brightest designers, Ivy Ross of Google.\nWe also like to make sure the folks who finance tech mix it up in Aspen. Kirsten Green of Forerunner Ventures returns to our stage. Politico Bradley Tusk, also a VC investor, will bring his strong personality to Aspen. So will RBC’s Mark Mahaney, whose lively stock-picking chatter brought down the house in 2017.\nThis is merely the first batch of headliners. We’ll have more soon. Brainstorm Tech is an invitation-only event, and you can request an invitation from me or any of the editorial co-chairs: Michal Lev-Ram, Andrew Nusca, and Leigh Gallagher.\n"}

A \"quasi\" real estate investment trust was approved last month to allow a Beijing-based condominium manager to offer retail investors securities backed against income from rental apartments, the first financial product of its kind in China.\nAll these new measures are part of a plan to improve affordability and stabilize home prices in the medium to long term, according to a report from global rating agency Moody's.\nZhang Dawei, a Centaline Property analyst, said the development of rental housing could help \"avert drastic ups and downs in the property market and reduce irrational demand.\"\nChina's once-sizzling property market has shown signs of cooling as prices have faltered in major cities amid tough government curbs. Central authorities have reiterated on many occasions that \"housing is for living in, not speculation.\"\nFor many new settlers in the cities, owning a house is too expensive while renting means less comfort, frequent moving, lack of public services and dealing with dishonest agents.\nMoody's said the push to boost rental housing would unlikely affect sales for property developers over the next six to 12 months, citing \"the general desire of the Chinese to own their homes.\"\nThe long-term potential is there: China's rental housing market will reach 4.2 trillion yuan (about $637 billion) in revenue by 2030, up from 1.3 trillion yuan now, according to a research report from Orient Securities.\nHowever, the development of the market will require \"continued government support to ensure the long-term effectiveness of aims such as cheaper land prices, facilitating funding channels and investment capital recycling, and promoting equal rights for owners and tenants,\" the rating agency said.\n"}

[Photo provided to China Daily]\nMajor e-commerce giants have increased efforts to recycle increasingly expensive cartons and promote the use of sustainable, greener packaging materials.\nIndustry statistics showed the price of raw paper has risen to 5,000 yuan ($754) per metric tonï¼which increased by nearly 70 percent within the yearï¼and put great pressure on carton manufacturers as well as caused carton shortage throughout the country.\nThe rise in the price of paper lies in the shrinkage of supply, including the shutdown of small paper mills and the country's curbs on solid waste imports to reduce environmental pollution, experts said, adding that paper manufacturers have to increase prices to transfer the rising costs.\nThe Ministry of Environmental Protection said in July that by the end of 2017, the country will ban the imports of 24 types of solid waste, including waste plastics, unsorted scrap paper, discarded textiles and vanadium slag.\nCainiao Network Technology Co Ltd, the smart logistics network of e-commerce giant Alibaba Group Holding Ltd, is putting more efforts into carton recycling to deal with the rise in carton costs.\nCainiao said it will carry out carton recycling in several key cities including Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Shenzhen and Hangzhou during the shopping festival on Nov 11 organized.\nBy cooperating with carton manufacturers, Cainiao will reprocess the cartons left behind by consumers and reproduce packaging boxes that are used in the express delivery industry, in order to save a large amount of natural resources, said company Vice-President Shi Miao.\nIn June 2016, Cainiao launched its first \"Green Action\" with a clear goal, which is equivalent to planting 36 million trees, reducing carbon emissions by 3.62 million tons and replacing 50 percent of its express packaging with full-biodegradation environmental-friendly materials by 2020.\nAnd in March, Cainiao Green Alliance Charity Fund, which was jointly established by China Environmental Protection Foundation, Alibaba Foundation, Cainiao Network and co-funded by several logistics enterprises, planned an investment of a total 300 million yuan in green packaging, recycling, delivery and intelligent processing.\nAccording to the National Bureau of Statistics, the price of corrugated paper, which was used to manufacture packing boxes reached 4,748 yuan each ton, hitting the highest level this year. The continuous rise of carton costs will have a serious influence on downstream enterprises.\nMore than 20 carton manufacturers across the country have raised their price by 100 to 500 yuan per ton since Sept 15.\n\"This round of price rise in paper industry has an impact on e-commerce platforms, but the degree may differentiate depending on the scale of these platforms,\" said a manager, who is in charge of storage and logistics at Mia.com, an infant care online retailer.\nHe said for some large e-commerce players, which have close cooperation with suppliers, the increase of costs may not be obvious, but he expects that small ones will witness a sharp jump in costs.\nMia has long-term carton suppliers, so the price rise is acceptable and the influence is very limited for them, he added.\nOnline shopping giant JD.com Inc, which offers nine major brands including Lego, Nestle and P&G, announced in June the launch of the Green Stream Initiative to promote the use of sustainable, greener packaging materials throughout the supply chain.\nBy 2020, JD expects to reduce the number of boxes used throughout the supply chain by 10 billionï¼the total number of all boxes used in China in all of 2015.\nLi Jiayue contributed to this story.\n"}

The French luxury goods company said its business in China was battered in the third quarter due to the wild stock market swings. [Photo/China Daily]\nFrench luxury retailer reels from austerity measures, slow sales\nLouis Vuitton has pulled the plug on one of its two flagship stores in Guangzhou, Guangdong province, as the French fashion house continues to grapple with slow sales in China.\nSeparately, the Financial Times said that the company has already closed three outlets in Chinaï¼Guangzhou, Harbin and Urumqiï¼and was drawing up plans to close several others, citing people familiar with the matter. The store closures will leave LV with about 50 stores across the mainland.\nThe Guangzhou outlet was located in the La Perle shopping mall and unconfirmed reports had said that the retailer's lease was set to expire at the end of this month.\nLV officials in Shanghai did not immediately respond to queries from China Daily on the development.\nIndustry experts, however, do not see anything untoward in the move as a senior company official had earlier in the year indicated that the company would close some of its stores in China as part of an ope--rational restructuring.\nJean-Jacques Guiony, chief financial officer of LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton, the world's largest luxury group by turnover and the parent of LV and about 70 other luxury brands, said during an earnings call last month that most of the store closures in China would be in the second-tier cities.\nGuiony said the group's business in China was battered in the third quarter due to the wild stock market swings. The group's revenue growth in Asia, except Japan, in the first nine months of this year fell by nearly 6 percent from a year earlier, despite an 18 percent increase in revenue to 25.3 billion euros ($27.1 billion) during the period.\nThis is, however, not the first time that foreign luxury brands are closing stores in China. Other leading retailers such as Giorgio Armani, Hermes and Versace have been closing shops since 2013.\nChina's slowing economic growth and the government's austerity campaign have triggered a steep fall in luxury consumption.\nData provided by market research firm Bain & Co show that luxury consumption in the Chinese mainland recorded a negative growth in 2014 for the first time, after years of rapid growth. The consultancy said that unlike the past two years, the current closures are a strategic adjustment and more brands will close stores this year.\n\"Luxury brands are preparing for the changed situation by store upgrades and downsizing,\" said Zhou Ting, director of Shanghai-based Fortune Character Research Center, a consulting firm for the luxury industry.\nZhou said for luxury brands, store upgrades and closures are a more viable option than investing further amounts on these outlets or opening new ones.\nZhou said some of the luxury brands are betting big on online platforms and have even cut product prices in China this year.\n\"What this means is that the rapid growth phase of the Chinese luxury market has passed and brands are now banking on strategy, technology and price adjustment for growth.\"\nThe testing times for luxury retailers has also affected the fortunes of high-end malls such as La Perle.\n\"We and Louis Vuitton decided not to renew the lease contract out of concerns for our respective development,\" the promotional department of La Perle Management Consulting Co Ltd told China Daily.\nOpened in 2003, the LV store used to occupy a conspicuous place on the left of the shopping mall's entrance. Now the store's door is closed and the windows are covered with the mall's posters, with only the Hermes store next door an indicator of its earlier glory.\nLa Perle officials said they will find another \"leading international luxury brand\" to fill the Louis Vuitton vacuum and it has no plan to shift its high-end retail focus. They, however, did not give any indication as to who the new client would be.\n\n\n\n\n2015 Beijing Forum for Emerging Markets\nChina-ASEAN Information Harbor Forum\nSummer Davos 2015\nCopyright 1995 - var oTime = new Date(); document.write(oTime.getFullYear()); .

Beating both Melbourne and Brisbane, you can expect to pay $100.68 for a pair of jeans.\nThe third most expensive U.S. city to appear in this year's list, life in L.A. requires a pay packet of almost celebrity proportions. Rental of a two bedroom unfurnished flat could set you back $4,040.\nThe capital of the UAE, Abu Dhabi has undergone serious growth and investment over recent years and, as such, there is a price tag to match as expats look to enjoy its glamorous attractions.\nLife in San Francisco is expensive. With its proximity to the coast and California's wine regions, it unsurprisingly ranks among the top 10 percent of the 200+ countries studied in Mercer's annual list.\nOsaka is one of Japan's thriving commercial centers and continues to offer an appealing - if expensive - home for expats.\nDubai, renowned for its modern architecture and brilliant beaches, is a top destination for expats looking to combine business opportunities with varied attractions.\nGuangzhou, a port city in the northwest of Hong Kong is the cheapest of five major cities in China - though it remains within the world's 20 most expensive.\nLife in the politically troubled Democratic Republic of the Congo is hard.

From new cars to used cars, consumers will have a much better user experience (UX) through the whole life cycle of a car.\n\"On Maodou.com, consumers can choose to rent a new car for one to three years, and then decide whether to purchase the car or change another new car to rent,\" said Yang Haoyong, chief executive officer of Maodou.com, the subsidiary of CARS, said in a media briefing in Beijing on Tuesday.\nYang added that \"in the past, the major threshold for Chinese car users was the price. Especially for the young people, or the millennial, who had not yet saved enough money to purchase a new car, the new-car brand may be a great news for them.\"\n\"The down-payment of the new car is as low as zero to 10 percent, then the user have a maximum of three years to drive his/her new car and decide whether to purchase it, or rent a new one,\" he said.\nThis is also a blessing for those who don't have a good luck in the license plate lottery system â mostly introduced in first-tier cities such as Beijing and Guangzhou.\n\"For those who face difficulty in getting a license number for a car, we provide the number for them for up to three years.\"\nDifferent from Guazi.com, which only provides used car, the new brand enables consumers to have their own new cars with a much lower threshold.\n\"Three years later, if you don't like the car, you can return it and get another brand-new car. This is particularly welcomed by the younger generation, who are fond of pursuing new things and keep on changing their minds,\" said Yang.\nSame as Guazi.com, Maodou.com takes advantage of the internet, using big data to gather information from its users and help the company provide better services and operate the system in a more efficient way.\nCARS has already attracted roughly $600 million financing in the B-round, fully propelling its used car and new car businesses.\nXu Xin, founder and president of Capital Today, one of the investors, said that \"with the internet constantly shaping the retail industry, we have now entered the era for 'new retail', a new form of retail driven by progress in technology.\"\n\"Automotive services industry, boosted by new science and technology, enjoys a numerous market volume and a promising, profitable future,\" she said.\n"}

Morgan, attended a preparatory meeting in Lujiazui.\nThe association aims to establish an exchange platform for global asset management institutions to help them set up in Lujiazui and understand China's asset management industry.\nYuan Yefeng, director of Lujiazui Financial City Authority's department for finance, shipping and innovation, told Xinhua that the association would attract more leading asset management organizations to do business in Shanghai.\nCurrently, more than 60 overseas asset management institutions have subsidiaries or plan to establish branches in Lujiazui. Nine of the top 10 global asset management institutions have wholly foreign-owned enterprises in Lujiazui.\nBy 2019, China will be the second largest asset management market in the world, with more than 17 trillion U.S. dollars of assets under management by 2030, up from 2.8 trillion dollars in 2016, according to Casey Quirk.\nIn September 2016, J.P. Morgan set up a wholly foreign-owned enterprise (WFOE) in Shanghai Free Trade Zone with the first WFOE asset management license in China.\nThe license allows a WFOE to offer onshore fixed income, equity, and multi-asset private funds to both institutional and high net worth investors in China.\n\"There was only member of staff when the WFOE was founded, but now there are 13. We are growing fast,\" said Zhou Lingling, deputy general manager with J.P. Morgan Asset Management (Shanghai) Ltd.\n\"We are confident of our performance in China and we will seize every chance in this market,\" said Zhou.

I believe it will be a great exchange platform for financial institutions like us,\" Zhou said.\nIn July last year, UBS Asset Management became the first international manager with a Qualified Domestic Limited Partner quota to receive a Private Fund Management license in China.\nGiven the license, UBS is able to provide a broad range of services to onshore and global investors, and to work more closely with subsidiaries of global firms in China to meet their domestic investment needs.\nGao Ting, head of China Strategy at UBS Securities Equity Research, said at the preparatory meeting that with China's efforts to open its capital markets to the world, A-shares will be included in the MSCI indices in June, making China's stock market more important for both onshore and offshore investors.\nMeanwhile, Chen Ting, general manager with BlackRock Investment Management (Shanghai) Limited Company, also showed her passion for the Chinese market.\nAt the World Economic Forum in Davos in January, China reiterated its commitment to opening banking, securities and insurance sectors.\n\"Given the opening-up policies and the pleasant business environment, Lujiazui Financial City in Shanghai will be the first choice for global financial companies to do business in China,\" Chen said.\nGlobal investment managers like J.P. Morgan and Vanguard are eyeing a share of China's public fund market as well as China's pension market, according to Chen.\n\"China plans to further open up the financial sector, which really means a lot to global market players.

The firm, overseen by Brazil’s richest man – 77 year-old Jorge Paulo Lemann – and backed by investor Warren Buffett, is a ruthless meritocracy, ready to sacrifice employees and the concerns of local communities in its effective pursuit of profits.\n\nColvin summarizes its acquisition-driven business model succinctly: 3G is “quite possibly the world’s best at creating value by eliminating costs and focusing on the most promising opportunities, but not adept at growing the top line organically. In such a model, performance is front-loaded in the years right after an acquisition…That’s why the shark must keep swimming.” You can read the full story, which is featured in the February edition of Fortune magazine, here.\nDavos is still abuzz about the bizarre role-reversal here, with China positioning itself as the champion of open global markets, while the U.S. threatens protectionism and the U.K. retreats from Europe.

Never downplay the spillover effects of financial woes into other economies as global markets are interconnected now more than ever.\nFully aware of the risks, the Chinese leadership is focused on tackling deep financial risks and sparing no efforts to address financial irregularities.\nAt the financial work conference, the leadership has the consensus that guarding against systemic financial risks is the eternal theme of financial work and the government should take a stronger initiative to monitor, warn against, and deal with risks in a timely manner.\nThe creation of a \"super regulator\" shed light on the new thinking of the central government in addressing financial woes. With the central bank given a bigger role, this new committee will enhance coordination and improve weak links in financial oversight.\nChina's financial risks are generally under control and the economy is equipped with ample ammunition to neutralize the risks.\nThe Chinese economy grew faster than expected in the second quarter with rebalancing efforts showing visible progress. A sound and stable macro-economic outlook has created room for regulators to intervene.\nThe economy is also backed by banking assets worth nearly 232 trillion yuan ($34.12 trillion), the largest in the world; its stock market is valued at about 52 trillion yuan; its public and private offered funds are worth 18 trillion yuan. Its insurance asset value is close to 16 trillion yuan.\nRegulators have not scaled down efforts to ward off risks. The central bank has adopted a macro-prudential assessment. The securities regulator has harshly punished a number of listed firms for illegal acts. Banking and insurance regulators have taken varied measures to keep risk in the sectors under control.\nWucker stated that a prime example of an ignored \"grey rhino\" is the 2008 financial crisis, which prompted many countries to loosen monetary policy and flooded their economies with cheap lending.\n\"If we do not address the unintended consequences, we are in for another huge fall,\" she said.\nGlobal finance is a network in which everything is connected to everything else. As China strengthens its financial security, it will act as a stabilizer in the global financial safety net.\n"}

{"title": "From Storm to Ultra, music festivals are growing in popularity in China", "author": "CNBC", "pub_time": "2017年9月22日", "url": "https://www.cnbc.com/2017/09/22/from-storm-to-ultra-music-festivals-are-growing-in-popularity-in-china.html", "content": "Summer might have drawn to a close, but the music festival season in China is still going strong.\nWhether it's the rock-oriented Midi Festival to the indie Strawberry Music Festival, live music events that run the gamut in terms of genres have been attracting greater numbers of attendees on the mainland.\nEven international brands like Ultra, the electronic music festival with roots in Miami, have been keen on getting a piece of the growing segment. The Chinese edition of the festival — which also makes stops in Japan, Brazil and Croatia as part of its international tour — debuted on the mainland for the first time earlier this month.\nOne other well-known name in the outdoor music festival segment is Storm, a homegrown live electronic dance music festival. The festival has seen its number of attendees rise from 24,000 at its inaugural run in 2013 to 180,000 last year.\nA total of 22.5 million unique views were recorded for the live video stream of Storm's two-day Shanghai show in 2016, according to Eric Reithler-Barros, managing director of A2LiVE, the entertainment company behind Storm.\nStill, the electronic music scene in China remains relatively nascent, with plenty of festival-goers at Storm indicating that it was their first experience at an outdoor concert, Reithler-Barros told CNBC.\nDespite the experience being a comparatively new one for Chinese audiences, locals still made up the majority of visitors to Storm, especially at its stops in Chengdu and Guangzhou. Across its five shows in 2016, an average of 84 percent of festival-goers were from mainland China, according to A2LiVE. Around 4 percent of visitors were from Taiwan, Hong Kong and Macau.\nThat enthusiasm has led Storm to expand in scale since its first show five years ago. The festival is headed to 7 cities in China this year, up from 5 cities it toured in 2016. While top-tier cities — such as Beijing and Shanghai — made the list, so did second-tier ones like Chengdu and Changsha.\nNew stops for the festival were chosen based on factors such as streaming statistics for EDM tracks on music streaming apps in China, said Reithler-Barros. A2LiVE also had its ear to the ground, paying attention to metrics such as the number of EDM events and clubs in various cities, he added.\nConsumer businesses, both international and local, are taking note of the growing interest for outdoor music festivals on the mainland too. Among Storm's past and present corporate sponsors are Budweiser, Adidas, Huawei, Pernod Ricard and Youku, Reithler-Barros indicated.\nThe number of outdoor music festivals has grown across Asia as disposable incomes in the region have increased: Thailand is home to Wonderfruit and Maya Music Festival, Hong Kong hosts the annual Clockenflap festival and the Laneway Festival, Neon Lights and ZoukOut all take place in Singapore.\nBesides growing affluence, one reason for the growing interest in festivals in China has been the proliferation of reality television programs featuring live music, said Christina Ding, a senior project manager at market research company Daxue Consulting.\nOne of those shows has been \"Rap of China,\" a reality hip-hop talent competition which racked up billions of views on internet video platform iQiyi since premiering in the summer. The show — a breakout hit — has influenced the creation of several hip-hop focused festivals, including MDSK and International Youth Music Festival.\n\"People want to experience such events for themselves\" after watching them on television, Ding explained.\nExperience-oriented younger consumers, who tend to make up the bulk of audiences at outdoor music festivals, were also willing to pay to attend festivals as their participation could be used as a differentiator of sorts on social media platforms like WeChat, Ding added.\n"}

[Photo/Agencies]\nAs the third batch of central State-owned enterprises to carry out mixed-ownership reform is likely to undergo process soon, a slew of funds backed by state capital sprang up to support the project across the country, China Securities Journal reported.\nLi Jin, chief researcher at the China Enterprise Research Institute, told the Journal that these specific funds are vital to expand capital investment and could best use market forces to inject vigor to the new round of SOE reform.\nIn August, the China Structural Reform Fund led by State-owned capital joined hands with Industrial and Commercial Bank of China Beijing branch and Beijing Wealth Capital to establish a special fund, which aims to invest in mixed-ownership reform and restructuring of central and local government-controlled enterprises.\nA similar fund was set up by Hebei State-Owned Assets Holding & Operation Co Ltd and CCB Trust Co Ltd in May with 50 million yuan ($7.59 million) registered capital, while such funds have also emerged in Shenzhen, Shanghai and Guangzhou.\nIn addition, a hundred-billion-level special fund is being planned to boost the mixed-ownership reform, according to The Economic Observer. It is reported that the fund would probably be inclined to private capital.\nIt was made clear at the State Council's executive meeting on Sept 27 that the reform and restructuring of central SOEs welcomes participation of both private and foreign capital. The new round of restructuring will be a key opportunity to boost reform and the institutional innovation of central SOEs.\nOn Sept 28, Xiao Yaqing, head of the State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission, said at a news conference, \"We welcome companies of all ownership types, including foreign companies, to participate in China's SOEs mixed-ownership reform\".\nUp to now, the last two batches of 19 central SOEs have undergone mixed-ownership reforms, involving areas such as electric power, oil, natural gas, railway, and telecommunications.\nOne recent example of this reform is China United Network Communications Group Co Ltd, the country's second-largest mobile carrier by subscribers. The firm carried out the mixed-ownership reform scheme in August and received capital from private investors â among them domestic tech titans Tencent Holdings Ltd, Alibaba Group Holding Ltd, Baidu Inc, JD.com Inc and Suning Commerce Group Co Ltd â by selling a 35.2 percent stake.\nThe reform and restructuring of central SOEs is to boost efficiency and promote supply-side structural reform. Since 2003, the total number of central SOEs has sharply fallen from 196 to 98.\n"}

The move comes after Wanda agreed in July to sell the bulk of its theme parks and hotel assets to Sunac China Holdings Ltd and Guangzhou R&F Properties Co. Wanda Commercial's dollar bonds due in 2024 dropped the most in a month.\n\"We expect Wanda Commercial's market position in its property development segment to weaken following the transition,\" S&P said. Wanda Commercial delisted from the Hong Kong stock exchange in September 2016, with the aim of eventually relisting on mainland. \"The prospects of the company's Ashare listing are unclear, and information risks have heightened.\"\nThe downgrade, which could make it costlier for Wanda to borrow money overseas, is the latest setback for billionaire Wang Jianlin. His companies have been selling assets, delaying or shelving deals amid scrutiny from Chinese authorities, who are clamping down on capital outflows. In the past couple of months, Wang agreed to sell most of Wanda's hotels and themepark assets for 63.75 billion yuan ($9.6 billion) and scrapped plans to buy a plot of land in central London.\nWanda Commercial couldn't immediately comment when contacted by phone about the downgrade.\nDalian Wanda Groupï¼the parent of the property subsidiaryï¼has faced increased scrutiny from the Chinese government on their overseas investments, as authorities try to slow capital outflows to prevent the yuan from weakening.\n\"We agree with S&Pï¼there are too many uncertainties in relation to Wanda's strategic change and no clear picture of its future plan,\" said Chuanyi Zhou, a credit analyst in Singapore at Lucror Analytics. \"Not to mention the possible nonbusiness risks.

The show will be globally televised on Nov 28 on CBS in 190 countries and regions worldwide.\nAfter the 2016 Victoria's Secret Fashion Show in Paris, the company received complaints from Chinese bloggers about the use of Chinese-themed dragons and other Chinese cultural symbols. So a lot is riding on the success of the inaugural effort in Shanghai.\nEd Razek, executive producer of the fashion show and Victoria's Secret chief creative officer, told Xinhua that there will be performances by former One Direction boy band member Harry Styles, Grammy-winning artist Miguel, Tony Award winner Leslie Odom Jr., and Chinese popstar Jane Zhang and solo pianist Yundi Li.\nIn addition, 55 models from 18 countries and regions will be strutting the catwalk, including top Chinese models Ju Xiaowen, Liu Wen, He Sui, Ming Xi, Wang Yi, Xie Xin and Estelle Chen.\nFounded in San Francisco in 1977, Victoria's Secret burst onto the American market by styling itself as an alternative to more humdrum, purely functional women's inner wear. The core strategy was to inject sex appeal into mass-market undies.\nThe strategy paid off and it became the largest American retailer of women's lingerie, pulling in $8 billion in revenue in 2016 despite an 11 percent dip in sales.\nStill, all is not rosy in the Victoria's Secret boudoir.\nWomen's groups have long decried its objectification of women's bodies. In \"Victoria's Dirty Secret\", a research article published by Canada's Wilfrid Laurier University and the University of Waterloo, its authors asserted, \"Victoria's Secret sends a message to these adolescent girls and women that their models are the standard of beauty. Women in these ads are highly objectified, idealized, and sexualized. If women feel they have to live up to this sociocultural norm standard, it is only telling men that it is okay to objectify and sexualize women.\"\nAs varying body types have become more accepted, competitors have gained ground, and the athleisure movement is luring more women to place stylish comfort over high-maintenance sex appeal.\nAdd to that the growing trend to shop online and even leading brands are feeling the burn. To trim corporate fat, Victoria's Secret recently canceled its print catalogue, dumped its swimwear line, and announced plans to lay off 200 employees.\nSo the booming Chinese market could be manna from heaven. Rapid economic growth and higher disposable income, combined with widespread exposure to leading global luxury brands has given Chinese consumers a taste for international brands and luxury merchandise.\nBig but no easy market\nAfter expanding internationally in the 1990s and 2000s in 38 countries and regions, Victoria's Secret entered China in 2015, opening its first storefront in Shanghai. Plans for a second store in Chengdu are in the works.\nSpurred on by trends in social media and fashion-forward celebrities, Chinese women are increasingly embracing luxury lingerie, and are willing to pay a premium for it.\nIn Victoria's Secret's pink glass-fronted, four-story flagship store on Huaihai Road near Shanghai's fashionable Xintiandi shopping district, prices range from 300 yuan ($45) to 4,000 yuan ($605) or more.\nThe store also features \"The Angel Suite\", one of only three in the world, with the other two being in New York and London, catering to VIP customers seeking to view the latest in lingerie fashions in a private and exclusive setting.\nHowever, while the Shanghai fashion show may create greater exposure, it can't solve the pressing issue of growing global competition.\nLuxury Italian lingerie maker La Perla already has eight stores in China with additional outlets coming down the pike. Canada's athleisure yoga brand leader Lululemon is also weighing in with a flagship store in Shanghai. And China's own Guangdong-based mass-market lingerie brand Cosmo Lady has already staked claim to 4 percent of the domestic market.\n"}

Ende vergangener Woche meldete eine Tochter-AG der Hainan Luftfahrtgruppe (HNA) der Hongkonger Börse, dass sie 7,8 Milliarden Renminbi (eine Milliarde Euro) als Kredit erhalten habe.\nSie wolle damit den Meilan-Flugplatz auf der südchinesischen Inselprovinz Hainan erweitern. Die Kredite hätten eine Laufzeit von 20 Jahren und seien von Chinas Entwicklungsbank und zwei Geschäftsbanken bewilligt worden. Als Garant bürgte die gesamte HNA-Gruppe.\nDer hoch verschuldete Gemischtwarenkonzern (Luftfahrt, Flughäfen, Immobilien, Hotels, Banken und Dienstleistungen) signalisierte damit, dass er in seinem Kerngeschäft wieder kreditfähig ist. Das gilt nicht für seine weltweiten Firmenaufkäufe und Beteiligungen, für die HNA offenbar nicht einmal mehr die Kreditzinsen zahlen kann.\nAllein für die laufenden Zinsen müsse HNA im ersten Halbjahr 15,6 Milliarden Renminbi (zwei Milliarden Euro) aufbringen, meldete am Donnerstag exklusiv das „China Business Journal“ auf seiner Webseite. Zudem sei die Gruppe mit kurzfristig fälligen Krediten in Höhe von mindestens 185,2 Milliarden Renminbi (23,8 Milliarden Euro) belastet.\nIm Januar hatte HNA-Vorsitzender Chen Feng zugegeben, dass er Zahlungsprobleme habe, weil HNA in der Vergangenheit im Ausland so viele Übernahmen getätigt habe. „Bloomberg“ titelte darauf: „HNA: Alles muss raus.“\nDer große Ausverkauf überschuldeter chinesischer Konzerne, die sich mit ihren Akquisitionen übernommen haben, hat begonnen. Der Staat hat vier Konzerne identifiziert, die einst die Lieblinge der Partei waren: neben der HNA den Versicherungskonzern Anbang, das Pharmaziegroßunternehmen Fosun und die Immobiliengruppe Dalian-Wanda.\nDie Staatsbanken haben ihnen seit vergangenem Jahr die Kredithähne zugedreht, nachdem ihre Einkäufe im Ausland nicht mehr zu Pekings Prioritäten passen. Sie sollen ausländische Hochtechnologie oder strategische Firmen kaufen, die ihr Kerngeschäft und das Modernisierungsprogamm China 2025 unterstützen. Für Imageprojekte gibt es keine Kredite und keine Devisen mehr.\nQuelle: picture alliance / Gao Lin/Imagi\nEin Beispiel: Bis Ende 2016 hatten chinesische Firmen mehr als 21 europäische Fußballklubs im Wert vor drei Milliarden Euro übernommen. Peking nennt das heute „irrationale Investitionen“.\nHNA hatte seit 2015 mindestens 25 Milliarden US-Dollar im Ausland investiert. Der Konzern kaufte 9,9 Prozent der Deutschen Bank und erwarb in den USA für 6,5 Milliarden Dollar Anteile der Luxushotelkette Hilton. Auf der Weltkarte seiner Immobilien stehen exklusive Adressen in New York, in Chicago, oder seine für 3,5 Milliarden US-Dollar gekauften Grundstücke im Kai-Tak-Gebiet von Hongkong.\nEnde Januar verkaufte HNA sein One York Office in Sydney. Er will sich auch von anderen Immobilen trennen. Nach Angaben der HNA-Webseite beschäftige der Konzern 410.000 Angestellte und besitzt Vermögenswerte von 145 Milliarden US-Dollar bei einem Jahresumsatz von 90 Milliarden Dollar.\nQuelle: Infografik Die Welt\nDie Führungs- und Unternehmensstruktur von HNA ist so intransparent, dass die Wirtschaftsagentur Bloomberg 192 Milliarden Dollar an Vermögenswerten errechnete, zu denen 30 Milliarden Dollar Aktienbeteiligungen und weltweite Immobilien im Wert von mehr als 14 Milliarden Dollar hinzukommen.\nAber Wanda-Chef Wang Jianlin, der einst seine privatwirtschaftliche Gruppe auf vier neue strategische Standbeine stellen wollte, als Kino-, Unterhaltungs-, Sportbusiness- und Tourismuskonzern, ist der größte Verlierer. Er investierte mehr als 20 Milliarden US-Dollar im Ausland. Nun musste er sich von allen Topimmobilien trennen, in London, Australien und jetzt in den USA (Beverly Hills und Chicago).\nEr gab seine Internetgesellschaft Feifan auf und entließ 95 Prozent seiner rund 4000 Angestellten, sagten Insider des Konzerns zu WELT. Im Pekinger Hauptquartier sei die Stimmung auf Grundeis und die Fluktuation hoch. „Wang schaut nur noch, wo er Cash herkriegt.“\nZwar gehören Wang noch seine Kinohäuser (AMC Theater, Wanda Cinemas, Hoyts Group, Odeon), Filmstudios (Hollywoods Legendary), Sportbeteiligungen und Agenturen (Infront). Im Inland besitzt er mehr als 200 Einkaufszentren und sieben Superluxushotels. Doch er musste alle seine Kultur-, Freizeit- und Erlebnisparks verkaufen, darunter seine spektakuläre Filmstadt in Qingdao.\nWang verramschte 91 Prozent der 13 Parks für umgerechnet 5,6 Milliarden Euro an den Immobilienkonzern Sunac. Er erhielt nicht einmal ein Zehntel seiner Gesamtinvestitionen zurück, schrieb diese Woche die finanzpolitische Zeitschrift „Caijing“ unter der Überschrift „Wandas bittere Kulturreise“.\nDie chinesische Wirtschaft ist im vergangen Jahr wieder stärker gewachsen. 2017 legte das Bruttoinlandsprodukt gegenüber dem Vorjahr um 6,9 Prozent zu.\nQuelle: WELT/ Thomas Laeber\n„Caijing“ enthüllte Wangs Zwangslage. An neun der 13 über Kredite finanzierten Themenparks wird noch gebaut. Wenn er sie nicht verkauft hätte, würde sich seine Schuldenlast um jährlich 100 Milliarden Yuan (15 Milliarden Euro) erhöhen. Zudem trennte sich der 63-Jährige von 77 seiner Luxushotels in China für umgerechnet 25 Milliarden Euro.\nEr verkaufte an Konkurrenten wie den Internetgiganten Tencent mehr als 14 Prozent Anteile an seiner Immobiliengesellschaft. Der Alibaba-Konzern beteiligte sich diese Woche an Wangs inländischer Filmgesellschaft Wanda Film Holding.\nDie ehrgeizigen Konzerne fielen auch über Pekings Politik. Seit Anfang 2017 hatte Chinas Zentralbank über ihre drei Aufsichtsbehörden begonnen, die Einkaufsbonanza chinesischer Investoren im Ausland über verschärfte Kapitalverkehrskontrollen und Kreditsperren zu stoppen.\nSie vermutete nicht nur Geldwäsche und Währungsspekulation hinter dem Kapitalabfluss, der Peking vergangenes Jahr zwang, eine Billion Dollar seiner Devisenreserven für Stützungskäufe zur Stabilisierung des Renminbi zu opfern. Peking witterte auch höchste Gefahren für Chinas Finanzsystem.\nDer Chef des Sozialversicherungsfonds Lou Jiwei, der einst 2013 bis 2016 Chinas Finanzminister war, brachte es Ende Januar auf einem Pekinger Finanzforum auf den Punkt: Chinas Finanzstruktur sei „schwerwiegend verkorkst“ und unkontrollierbar, ob es um Schattenbanken, die vielen Finanzvehikel oder um eine Politik des lockeren Geldes bei hohen Kreditkosten gehe.\nQuelle: picture alliance / Maxpp/dpa\nDer 68-jährige Lou verglich die Lage chinesischer Finanzmärkte mit denen der USA vor zehn Jahren, als die Weltfinanzkrise ihren Ausgang nahm. „Bei uns ist es noch chaotischer.“ Die realen Gefahren, „die zu systemischen Finanzrisiken führen könnten“, würden aber erst erkennbar, wenn man tief auf den „Grund der Finanzprodukte“ hinabblickt.\nDas Finanzmagazin „Caixin“ erklärte auch den Hintergrund: Seit 2008 hätten sich die Vermögensanlagen im chinesischen Bankensystem auf 240 Billionen Yuan vervierfacht, nachdem Peking mit aufgeblähter Kreditpolitik die Folgen der Weltfinanzkrise konterkarierte. Das Kreditwachstum überflügelte prompt das Wirtschaftswachstum (BIP). Die Verschuldung stieg von 148 Prozent des Bruttoinlandsprodukts im Jahre 2007 auf 260 Prozent im Juni 2017.\nChinas Politik will nun alles durchforsten. Der Staat reguliert wieder, weil er den Markt versagen sieht. Kollateralopfer des neuen Kontroll- und Verbotsregimes wurden die unkontrolliert expandierenden Unternehmensgruppen wie HNA und Wanda. Ökonom Zhu Ning, Vizepräsident des Shanghaier Finanzinstituts, sagte zu WELT, dass für sie „alles auf einmal kam“.\nDie Kapitaltransfers der vier Konzerne schätzt er auf ein Drittel aller Auslandsakquisitionen in den vergangenen zwei Jahren. Zudem finanzierten sie ihre Dollarauslandsschulden mit einheimischen Krediten. Anders als bisher unbehelligte Großinvestoren wie der E-Kommerzriese Alibaba, der an die New Yorker Börse ging, büßten HNA oder Wanda durch Renminbi-Verluste doppelt.\nPekings Ordnungskampagne der Finanzmärkte soll drei Jahre dauern, sagte Politbürofunktionär Liu He, Wirtschaftsberater von Parteichef Xi Jinping, auf dem Weltwirtschaftsforum in Davos. Auf seinem Wirtschaftsparteitag im Januar hatte Xi die Ordnung der Finanzen zur „allerhöchsten Priorität“ für 2018 erklärt.\nNach seinem Credo hat sich die Finanzpolitik „von ihrer Aufgabe, die Realwirtschaft zu entwickeln, entfernt“. Sie erlaubte kontraproduktive „virtuelle Spielereien“, wie sich „Geld durch Geld gebiert“. Der Finanzsektor hätte der „technologischen Innovation in den Unternehmen und der Entwicklung kleiner und mittlerer Industrien zu dienen“, so Xi. China müsse vermeiden, dass es zu systemischen Krisen kommt.\nWie wirkungsvoll Verbote des Staates in der so chinesischen Wirtschaft sind, enthüllte das Handelsministerium vergangenen Monat. Bereits 2017 fielen offiziell verbuchte chinesische Auslandsinvestitionen durch die neue Politik um fast 30 Prozent auf 120 Milliarden Dollar. Neuinvestitionen in Immobilien oder Firmenübernahmen bei Unterhaltung, Sport und Freizeit stagnierten 2017.\n„Nullwachstum“ meldete das Ministerium. China gab seinen Titel, Asiens größter Aufkäufer von US-Immobilien zu sein, 2017 an Singapur ab. Anlagen chinesischer Investoren in den USA fielen um 66 Prozent auf 5,9 Milliarden US-Dollar.\nDie Botschaft scheint aber noch nicht überall angekommen zu sein, dass Chinas omnipotente Investoren im Ausland künftig nur noch kaufen sollen, wonach Partei und Staat für die Modernisierung der Wirtschaft und China 2025 verlangen. Sonst kriegen sie keine Kredite.\nRund sechs Millionen Tonnen Plastikabfall werden jährlich in Deutschland produziert, ein Viertel davon wurde bisher nach China geschifft.

Moving from cold and crisp to hot and sticky is a big step for regular economic conference groupies and, despite superficial similarities, the meetings are very different, too.\nThe World Economic Forum in Davos is an annual global jamboree attended by the great and the good, but the Boao Forum has a special significance because of its focus on China and the Chinese economy. It’s more like the US Federal Reserve’s annual symposium in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, where the focus is on the United States.\nThere is no more important time than the present to be looking at the Chinese economy, as US President Donald Trump’s trash talk on trade continues apace. The markets were spooked by some serious falls on the announcement of the first likely Trump tariff proposals. These were followed by Chinese retaliatory tariffs, and then a further US retaliation to the retaliation.\n“Ya, boo, sucks” is not the finest way to conduct international diplomacy so most observers, including myself, who were watching President Xi Jinping expected that he would take the moral high ground, be reasonable and statesmanlike and would be shocked at the thought that there should be any restriction in globalisation or trade (that has served China particularly well). A positive comparison to Trump’s emotional approach was an easy shot.\nXi played the part perfectly – but there was a twist. He came out with an unexpectedly conciliatory manner, spending the first third of his speech appearing to talk to his own constituency at home in China about the need for domestic economic reform. Almost as if he was campaigning for election.\nThis is an important turning point. It is now 40 years since China opened up as a very poor developing economy, when other nations were prepared to give the country a huge amount of slack. Hundreds of millions of people spent two generations working to get out of poverty. China is now a major developed economy of global stature. Xi is perhaps the first president to recognise that China is way past being a developing teenager and now has to act its age on the world stage.\nThe size of the economy means that China is now not only a major economic trading partner but also an opponent and indeed adversary in world trade. The country can no longer demand a free ride. Yet barriers to imports and foreigners, more akin to a developing country, still exist.\nNo one can expect China to become an immediate convert to full free trade but the best way to identify a level playing field is to imagine that, by some strange fantasy, China was granted membership of the European Union. Out would go the state subsidies to failing companies, out would go state-sponsored oligarchies, out would go counterfeiting, out would go restricted foreign ownership, and out would go a currency carefully managed by the central bank.\nThe very high bar called “national interest” which restricts large areas of the economy to foreign influence would not go out – but it could be significantly lowered, and focused on defence and proprietary technology.\nXi the statesman is also Xi the pragmatist – for China is at a serious disadvantage to the US in a trade skirmish. As of December last year, according to US census data, 25 per cent of China’s exports go to the US (that’s 6 per cent of China’s gross domestic product); the US exports only 5 per cent to China (0.6 per cent of GDP).\nXi stands up for globalisation and free trade at Asia’s Davos\nThe trade surplus between US imports, at US$130 billion last year, and exports, at US$505 billion, is less a badge of honour than an embarrassing millstone. Xi himself said that no country needs a surplus that big. China has to keep 40 per cent of its foreign reserves in US Treasury bonds (US$1.2 trillion). Try to sell those assets and you destroy your own savings.\nPerhaps the biggest surprise of Xi’s speech was that he did not save face by just saying, “You’re not going to push us around”. On the contrary, Xi emphasised that China’s economy needs reform and pointed out that opening up would help both sides. More than that, global economies and stock markets thought it a pretty good idea, too.\nAmerica can still say talk is cheap – and reform takes a long time. There will be a period where Trump will have to trust, and verify. If Xi is able to open up the economy as dramatically as Deng Xiaoping did 40 years ago, by putting aside the concept of face, he will be close to grasping the cloak of global statesmanship.\nRichard Harris is a veteran investment manager, banker, writer and broadcaster and financial expert witness. www.portshelter.com\nYou are signed up.

So I think the Trump administration understands that this is an area where they want to promote more trade,\" Syngenta CEO Erik Fyrwald told CNBC Wednesday.\nSince becoming U.S. president, Trump has touted an \"America first\" message of economic nationalism. In recent months, the former New York businessman has enacted some sweeping changes to U.S. trade policies, threatened to impose steep tariffs on imports and proposed hefty tax cuts.\nHowever, while speaking on the sidelines of Fortune's Brainstorm Tech International conference in Guangzhou, China, Syngenta's Fyrwald said he believed Trump understood the importance of encouraging agricultural trade internationally.\nWhen asked whether his message to the Trump administration would be to tread carefully in order to avoid the possibility of farmers becoming collateral damage, Fyrwald replied: \"Yes.\"\n\"And keep in mind that it is a very important element of exports for the United States and you want to expand it and not contract it. It's good for the globe to expand trade and agricultural trade is one of those critical pieces,\" he added.\n\nPlaying\nShare this video...\nWatch Next...\n"}

It's pretty hard to come up against these companies.\"\nChinese Search engine Sogou (SOGO) debuted at $13 a share on the New York Stock Exchange Thursday, giving the company a market value of about $5.4 billion. Tencent has a 43.7 percent holding of Sogou's Class A and Class B shares, according to Sogou's September filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, accessed through S&P Capital IQ.\nSogou is just the latest Tencent investment to go public. Tencent subsidiary and e-book company China Literature debuted in Hong Kong on Wednesday local time in a public offering which was oversubscribed by more than 600 times and roughly doubled on its first day of trading. Tencent is also reportedly planning an IPO of its music streaming unit, and per S&P Capital IQ is the second-largest investor in Sea, a $4.8 billion Southeast Asian internet company that listed on the NYSE on Oct. 20.\nEarlier that week, Alibaba's affiliate, Ant Financial, backed microlender Qudian's public offering on the New York Stock Exchange. Alibaba was also behind the September IPO of Best, a $4.4 billion logistics company.\n\"Some of the bigger companies like Alibaba, Tencent, they add a lot of credibility to the deals because they're known names,\" said Drew Bernstein, co-head of the China practice at Marcum Bernstein & Pinchuk, an auditor of Chinese IPOs in the U.S. \"They're investing in basically something that's going public and they know that their name carries weight. If they bring credibility, they bring value.\"\nWith Sogou, 11 Chinese companies have gone public in the U.S. this year, according to Renaissance Capital, on pace for the highest number of Chinese IPOs in the U.S. since 2014 when 16 such companies, including Alibaba, went public.\nAlibaba Group has a market capitalization of $475 billion. Its shares are up about 111.7 percent this year. The Chinese e-commerce giant run by Jack Ma also has several affiliates in payments, logistics and cloud computing. In the last few years, Alibaba has branched out into media and sports with its investment into Guangzhou Evergrande Football Club and purchase of the South China Morning Post newspaper. The latest moves by Ma, who is executive chairman, ahead of China's version of Black Friday, Singles Day on Nov. 11, are recording a duet with pop star Faye Wong and starring in a short martial arts movie.\nTencent co-founder Pony Ma is far more low-key than Alibaba's founder, although the company's messaging app WeChat dominates China. The company reported 963 million monthly active users for the app, known locally as Weixin, in the second quarter. Tencent is listed in Hong Kong and has a market capitalization of 3.68 trillion Hong Kong dollars ($470 billion). The shares are up 104 percent in local currency terms this year.\nTim Seymour, managing partner at Triogem Asset Management, said investing in some of the largest East Asian companies is like investing in a venture capital firm. Venture capital typically can involve more risk, but potentially higher reward for investors.\n\"Thus far their VC approach is well documented in China and Asia, but significantly less so in the USA,\" Seymour said of Tencent.\nNot only does Tencent have holdings in some of the latest IPOs, but the company took a nearly 5 percent stake in Tesla earlier this year, according to S&P Capital IQ. On Wednesday, a day after Snap reported a huge revenue miss, the company said Tencent now has a roughly 10 percent stake in the Snapchat parent.\n\"We believe Tencent views this investment as a strategic move and it may explore opportunities to collaborate, especially on mobile game publishing and newsfeed,\" Morgan Stanley equity analyst Grace Chen, who is overweight on Tencent, said in a Wednesday note. \"We will monitor Tencent's action plan, but view the investment as a potentially positive move if it is able to execute as intended; we view it as one of Tencent's initial steps towards globalization.\"\n— CNBC's Michael Bloom contributed to this report.\nDisclosure: CNBC parent NBCUniversal is an investor in Snap.\n\nPlaying\nShare this video...\nWatch Next...\n"}

Off it however, they are very real in reflecting the growing superiority of English over Spanish clubs in terms of financial clout – after factors such as debt are taken into account.\nThe Soccerex Football Finance 100 index, published this week, evaluates the top 100 clubs around the world based on their finances. The analysis by the football events company puts Manchester City at the top of the global rankings – with a Football Finance Index (FFI) score of 4.883 – ahead of Arsenal in second place (4.559). Real Madrid and Barcelona “languish” in sixth and 13th place respectively.\nThese are just some of what Soccerex calls many “eye-catching” results. No fewer than five English clubs occupy places in the top ten, significantly outperforming La Liga’s “Clásico duo”.\n\nThe study underlines how world football has changed over the past two decades – thanks to increased broadcast revenue and, significantly, vast amounts of cash pumped in by global billionaires from Europe, Asia Pacific, the Middle East and the Americas.\nThe Middle East is represented by two of the top three clubs, with Abu Dhabi-owned Manchester City at number one and Qatar-owned Paris Saint-Germain in third position.\nCity’s fortunes have been transformed since the club was taken over in 2008 by multibillionaire owner Shaikh Mansour bin Zayed Al Nahyan. Twice winners of the Premier League since then, Pep Guardiola’s team are 15 points clear and in pole position to win it again this season.\n\nYears of underperformance are now buried in the past for the French club, which has become a major European force since being owned by Qatar Sports Investments. PSG smashed the world transfer record last August to sign Brazilian superstar Neymar.\nThe growing influence of Asia – and particularly China – is seen by the presence of Guangzhou Evergrande in fourth position. The Chinese Super League has nine clubs in the top 100 – more than France, Germany and Italy.\nHowever, the finance league table does not necessarily reflect money splashed around in the transfer market.\nArsenal have been criticised for being relatively spendthrift in the search for new players, and failed to qualify for this season’s Champions League. Yet the club sits in second place, Soccerex explaining that the North London club’s “lofty position” reflects its “sound business model”.\nChelsea would move up from ninth to fifth, the study says, were owner Roman Abramovich’s investment listed as sponsorship, as with other clubs, than as a loan.\nThe new annual report takes account of five variable factors in its calculations: playing assets, fixed qataassets, money in the bank, potential owner investment and net debt.\nSoccerex explains the relatively lowly positions of Real Madrid and Barcelona by their member ownership structures and lack of potential owner investment. But the study says should Real be capitalised on the stock markets, their overall financial power “would make them worth more than any tycoon’s club”.\nHowever, the report highlights the increasing impact of foreign ownership on La Liga following recent Chinese investment in Atletico Madrid (15th) and the backing of Singapore’s Peter Lim for Valencia (29th).\nSoccerex says its study was based on clubs' balance sheets and annual reports from 2015-16 as well as other renowned sources of information.\n\nShare this article\nRussia\nRussia\nItaly\nView\nView\nworld news\n\n"}

A number of companies have mushroomed to serve the increased demand, and many have scored funding with little fuss.\n\"The proliferation of mobile, a burgeoning middle class, and pro-fitness government policies are enabling the rise of fitness tech in China and India,\" venture capital research firm CB Insights said in a recent report.\n\"For example, in June 2016, the Chinese State Council issued a plan to implement a national fitness strategy to improve the physical fitness and health levels of the entire country by 2020,\" the report said.\nSimilarly, India's National Skill Development Corporation is funding a K11 Academy of Fitness Sciences in North India, instructing young personal trainers, the report added.\nAs the sector matures, Asian companies have been punching above their weight. The region accounted for 30 percent of all investment deals in the fitness tech sector in the 10 months through October, up 10 percentage points from a year ago.\n\"Investors are realizing that there is a great opportunity to tap into the fitness category, because consumers are spending a lot of money on these services, along with associated products, such as apparel and adjacent services such as nutrition,\" said Anagha Hanumante, Intelligence Analyst at CB Insights.\nBut there are signs of fatigue kicking in. Overall investments in the sector will rise this year, but the money will be spread over fewer deals, suggesting investors are getting more selective with their bigger bets.\nCB Insights data show more than 130 deals had taken place until October, driving more than $685 million dollars into the fitness tech sector globally. However, just two transactions — cycling start-up Peloton Interactive and on-demand workout app ClassPass — accounted for more than half of the overall pie.\nIn comparison, the sector attracted $482 million dollars in funding across 208 deals in 2016, the current annual record. Industry observers say a key concern is that a number of companies have very similar offerings, making it hard to differentiate.\n\"One realizes the market is becoming extremely competitive and commoditized,\" said Natasha Gulati, Industry Manager at Frost and Sullivan.\nThat's not to say all is doom and gloom in the sector.\nSingapore startup GuavaPass is one of the most well funded fitness ventures in Asia, according to CB Insights. The business raised $5 million in Series A funding in late 2016, led by Vickers Venture Partners.\n\"GuavaPass experienced tremendous subscriber growth in 2017, with the membership base growing by thousands of new members each month, outpacing the company's growth rate in 2016,\" Rhyce Lein, GuavaPass Singapore general manager, told CNBC.\nLaunched in 2015, it now serves 10 cities across Asia and the Middle East, operating boutique fitness studios and classes through a subscription service.\n\"From an expansion perspective, GuavaPass continues to evaluate opportunities to expand in other cities within Asia and the Middle East. With the overall secular growth in the fitness, health and wellness industry, new opportunities will spring up in 2018,\" Lein added.\nBeyond Singapore, macroeconomic fundamentals have underpinned solid growth of fitness tech in India and China, helping the industry attract capital and driving growth, while also opening the door to initial public offerings, further investment rounds, or private investment.\nIntegrated wealth and fitness platform, CureFit, is among India's most well-funded platforms, raising $47 million in total disclosed funding, according to CB Insights.\nMeanwhile, Chinese fitness start-up Keep, which provides workout videos and apps, announced in late August it had obtained 100 million users. That compares to around 60 million in October 2016 and just 10 million in November 2015.\nWhile the sector has seen record global investment, and Asian fitness tech businesses are mostly well capitalized, not everyone is bullish on the outlook.\nAccording to Gulati, the future success of some businesses in the fitness tech space will be pegged to how a company can integrate devices and services, to ensure an expanding subscriber base and recurring revenue.\n\"The key here is how the device and the data generated by it are being used,\" she added.\nOthers are also staying cautious, with private equity firm Sports Capital Advisors passing over a number of investment opportunities this year.\n\"We looked at a couple of them, but ultimately didn't invest in this sub sector,\" Marcus John, CEO of Sports Capital Advisors, told CNBC.\n\"Not necessarily because they were not good — but because there are so many areas across the sport ecosystem which are fast growing and were ultimately priorities for us,\" he added.\nDespite the caution, John isn't ruling out a future play, saying not one technology, methodology or app will necessary emerge as a clear winner.\n\"The overall fitness sector in Asia is still quite new, compared to the west, and the 'shake out' will take several more years. No one can really predict what the local consumer will ultimately adapt to,\" he said.\n—Correction: This report has been updated to accurately reflect the name of Sports Capital Advisors\n\nPlaying\nShare this video...\nWatch Next...\n"}

On the other hand, developments in Beijing should at least offer some comfort. From foreign policy to trade, hawks have replaced moderates as the top policymakers at the White House under US President Donald Trump. A potential trade war is looming. So there is at least some reassurance that President Xi Jinping has put together a new economic team headed by Liu He.\nAs the new vice-premier, Liu has already been dubbed the “economic tsar”. Meanwhile, Yi Gang, a US-trained economist, has replaced the highly regarded Zhou Xiaochuan as head of the central bank. Both men are seen as reform-minded, but have their work cut out for them.\nUS and China remain on brink of trade war, but the big guns have yet to be fired, analysts say\nLiu has made it clear that Beijing wants to compromise and avoid conflicts with the US, though not at the expense of China’s own economic interests. He headed to Washington last month to try to defuse tensions and is now in close touch with US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin to find common ground.\nWhen he led the Chinese delegation to the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, this year, he promised that Xi would launch a reform drive that would exceed “the international community’s expectations”.\nNeedless to say, placating the Americans and liberalising the domestic economy are intricately linked. Liu has warned against using loose monetary policy to stimulate growth, a strategy China employed during the first few years of the global financial crisis a decade ago.\nIn this, he is in full agreement with Yi. Both men have vowed to rein in rising debt and the associated risks in the financial and banking sectors. They are following the new policy template laid down by Xi, who has declared battle on three fronts – financial risk, environmental degradation and poverty.\nXi has made his intentions clear by putting the two men in charge of economic and monetary affairs, respectively. As head of the newly created Financial Stability and Development Commission, Liu will coordinate policy between the central bank and financial regulators.\nChina hits back at Trump with retaliatory tariffs on 128 US imports, worth US$3 billion a year\nThe two technocrats even have similar academic backgrounds: both belonged to the first generation of students who were able to attend university when Deng Xiaoping started to open up China. Liu subsequently went to Harvard’s Kennedy School of Government, while Yi received his PhD in economics from the University of Illinois.\nJust this week, Mnuchin said he was hopeful a deal could be reached to avert a trade war. A speedy resolution will not only be good for both countries, but strengthen the credibility of the men put in charge of executing Xi’s policy agenda. Deleveraging and reforming the economy, along with liberalising the yuan, will be hard work.\nYou are signed up. We think you'd also like\n"}

Answering the impassioned cry of craft beer fans, Stone designed an uninterrupted cold chain delivery approach from San Diego, all the way to bars, restaurants and beer shops around China. This capability positions the brewery as a pioneer, offering China the most diverse, innovative and fresh portfolio of craft beer from the States.\nWhile Chinese beer fans are already familiar with many US brands, including Stone, the market has had little access to fresh, well-handled craft beer. Much of the beer currently available in China has been mishandled via the grey market. These beers are shipped warm and are often long out-of-code with the âenjoy byâ dates removed. Fresh Stone beer always boasts bold and complex flavor profiles, preserved by proper cold chain distribution standards.\nNow, through special efforts, Stone beer is being regularly shipped to China via its cold, expedited supply chain. The beerâs temperatures are tracked throughout the entire shipping process, ultimately arriving at bars and restaurants equally committed to freshness. Each of these destinations is hand-selected by local Stone Brewing team members for their commitment to maintaining the quality of the beer in storage and in serving. Stoneâs first shipment of fresh beer landed in early October to great local excitement. The Stone team celebrated the momentous accomplishment with a series of events at which fans had the exclusive opportunity to sip the freshest Stone beers China has ever known alongside the co-founders and CEO.\nâI returned from China energized and blown away by the welcome we received,â said Greg Koch, Stone Brewing executive chairman & co-founder. âOur reputation had evidently preceded us, and I loved being there as our fans enjoyed the bold and complex aromas and flavors of Ã¼ber fresh Stone beers for the first time.â\nWhether at home or abroad, always check for the âbottled / canned onâ date and âenjoy byâ date clearly printed on all Stone beers. If those dates are missing, the beerâs quality may be compromised.\nSome of the locations throughout China now stocking fresh, cold, Stone beers include:\nAbout Stone Brewing\nFounded by Greg Koch and Steve Wagner in 1996, the groundbreaking San Diego-based Stone Brewing is the 9th largest craft brewer in the United States.

Now halfway through its duration, the spending power of 1.4 billion Chinese has been unleashed on the world's entertainment and tourism industries.\nLondon, in which the Brexit-weakened pound has proved a boon for international visitors looking for a better deal, has already been enjoying a bumper week. The Hippodrome Casino, located near tourist hotspot Leicester Square, has said that the U.K.'s capital could see up to 300,000 more Chinese visitors this week. This is a marked increase on the 54,000 Chinese visitors to the U.K. in the first quarter of 2017, a figure which was already up 27 percent year-on-year.\nAccording to the New West End Company, citing figures from retail research firm Global Blue, international spending in London's West End in July 2017 had risen by 20 percent year-on-year. Chinese shoppers spent the most, shelling out an average of £1,478 ($1,946) at each transaction. The number of visitors specifically from the Middle Kingdom had also grown 31 percent year-on-year in July.\n\"Demand is sure to continue throughout Golden Week,\" Jace Tyrrell, chief executive of the New West End Company, a body representing the area, said in a statement Friday.\nIan Haworth, head of PR at the Hippodrome, which claims to be the U.K.'s largest international-style casino, told CNBC that Golden Week had been important to the business since it opened in 2012. As part of this effort, it currently employs 12 Mandarin or Cantonese-speaking staff.\nMeanwhile, Aspers Casino in Stratford told CNBC that it had hosted a VIP party in honor of Golden Week.\nChinese tourism to the U.K. across the board is ballooning. According to VisitBritain, the U.K.'s official tourism board, citing data from ForwardKeys, flight bookings from China to the U.K. for the September to November period of 2017 are up 10 percent year-on-year.\nVisitBritain added in its statement that it would be sending a \"large scale travel trade mission\" to China in November. Destination Britain China would involve the meeting of 65 U.K. tourism companies with China's \"top travel agents\" in Guangzhou.\nBut while international spending in London's tourist hotspots is on the up, some dark clouds loom on the horizon. Sterling, despite recovering some losses since its initial plummet following the U.K.'s vote to exit the European Union, is still down some 12 percent since before June 2016's referendum.\n\"Many retailers have concerns about domestic consumer confidence and rising costs as we await firm plans for our exit from the European Union,\" Tyrrell warned in his statement.\nCorrection: This article was amended to clarify that London, not the Hippodrome Casino specifically, could see up to 300,000 more Chinese tourists this Golden Week.\n\nPlaying\nShare this video...\nWatch Next...\n"}

For China, the institutionalisation of leadership succession was one of Deng Xiaoping’s most important legacies, signalling an end to the wrenching instability of the chaotic leadership cult of Mao Zedong. For the West, the term limit was an ideological bridge that led to a path of engagement. Could its abolition be the tipping point for an already precarious Sino-American relationship?\nStart with China and what the move means for its future. To figure out what will change under a different framework for leadership succession, it is important to cut through the authorities’ opaque rhetoric – the “moderately well-off society” transitioning into the “new era” – and stress-test their basic development strategy.\nWhile anything is possible, and there is always a risk of mistakes, my bet is that China stays its current course. Succession or not, there can be no turning back from a transition that has brought a large, poor developing country to the brink of prosperity as a modern, high-income economy.\nInitially, China’s leadership – responding to former premier Wen Jiabao’s surprising 2007 critique of a Chinese economy that had become increasingly “unstable, unbalanced, uncoordinated and unsustainable” – made its case from an analytical perspective. Last October, in a speech to the 19th party congress, President Xi Jinping made the same point from an ideological perspective, reframing the so-called Marxian principal contradiction around the pitfalls of “unbalanced and inadequate” development.\n\nSignificantly, these two perspectives – analytical and ideological – take China to the same destination: a prosperous economy and society with a thriving middle class. To get there, China must go through a transformative rebalancing, from manufacturing to services, from export dependence to domestic consumption, from state-owned to private, and from rural to urban.\nBy now, all of this is well understood. The current debate in China is less about strategy design and more about implementation. This, in fact, was Xi’s highest priority on assuming office in late 2012, and it formed the rationale behind an unprecedented anti-corruption campaign aimed at dislodging deeply entrenched power blocs that have stymied the transition.\nBut now, five years later, the Chinese leadership is poised to tackle the next phase of the implementation challenge. There is a palpable sense of urgency to this task. Behind the public façade of a confident leader, Xi has owned up to the possibility of failure. From an analytical perspective, this has been expressed in terms of a Japanese-like stagnation if China mismanages its economy. From an ideological perspective, an endgame of chaos and revolution looms if the “principal contradiction” is not resolved.\nGiven these mounting concerns, implementation risks are now being presented in a different light. At the World Economic Forum in Davos in January, Liu He, China’s new vice-premier for economic policy, hinted that upcoming reforms would be carried out with surprising speed. In a recent signed commentary published in People’s Daily, he also noted that, “strengthening the party’s overall leadership is the core issue”.\nThese views do not come out of thin air. Liu, a master tactician, seems to be underscoring the link between leadership power and the pace of reforms. The perceived need for greater leadership power – reflected in the elimination of the presidential term limit – has become a key element of the authorities’ implementation efforts. Consistent with Xi’s early instincts, this may well be the only way for China to avoid the “blind alley” of which Deng warned in 1992.\nYes, viewed from the perspective of liberal democracies, China’s constitutional revision is a disappointing governance setback. From China’s perspective, however, it may well be the only option to address its daunting implementation imperatives head-on. And the recent experience of other countries, particularly the United States, certainly cautions against the Western tendency to conflate succession and leadership quality.\n\nAmerica’s leadership deficit is, in fact, pushing the US and China to the brink of a trade war. The plight of the US middle class has been framed as a blame game, with China and its alleged unfair trading practices singled out as the culprit. Yet the evidence points elsewhere: to a dramatic shortfall of domestic saving that leaves America dependent on surplus saving from abroad to fill the gap. The result is a multilateral trade deficit, with China and 101 other countries, required to provide the foreign capital needed for the balance of payments.\nIn other words, China is actually an important part of America’s “solution” to its saving-short growth problem. Yet US leaders find it expedient to make China a scapegoat. And the situation is going from bad to worse. The large tax cut enacted at the end of 2017 will expand the US federal budget deficit by US$1.5 trillion over the next decade, pushing domestic saving even lower – an outcome that will lead to even wider trade deficits.\nAs if that’s not bad enough, a protectionist Trump administration has elevated anti-China tariffs to a central role in its international policy agenda. Yet protectionism in the face of widening trade deficits spells nothing but trouble for frothy financial markets and a saving-short US economy. And it risks the most serious rupture in the Sino-American relationship since 1989.\nNo one knows how long Xi will remain in office. If China stays the course, the succession question is inconsequential – at least for the time being. If China slips, the verdict will be very different. While the US has a very different political feedback loop, accountability also matters. In the end, the quality of leadership is what matters most for both countries. Sadly, those living in glass houses always find it easiest to throw stones.\nStephen S.

It also recently finalised the terms of the sale of the brand names no longer used in the UK to Guangzhou Sunrise Trading Limited.\nA spokesperson for House of Fraser confirmed to just-style that a leading credit insurer has decided to stop offering cover to some of its suppliers. The decision is understood to have been taken a month ago. The insurer covers around 20 of House of Fraser's 650 suppliers.\nThe spokesperson for the retailer said no other insurers have pulled cover and that the overall impact to business so far has been \"limited.\"\nThe cover is seen as standard in the retail clothing industry and provides suppliers with protection in the period between an order being accepted and payment being made in case the retailer cannot pay its bills. If an insurer refuses cover then suppliers often demand upfront payment, placing further pressure on the retailer's working capital.\nThe loss of cover was seen as a contributing factor in the demise of BHS and Woolworths. Earlier this month, UK fashion retailer New Look also had credit insurance withdrawn for many of its suppliers.\nA source close to the insurer told The Sunday Times it had taken the decision because of the \"structure and state of the company\" and the issues it faced \"generally\". Ted Baker is believed to be among the brands affected by the withdrawal.\nThis is not the first time the department store retailer has lost credit insurance. It is thought to have happened at least once before, after the 2008 financial crisis. The management team are understood to have negotiated relaxed terms from its lender, HSBC, and payment plans with its brands.\nThe move comes just a month after House of Fraser called on its landlords to reduce its rent bills. The retailer has been undertaking a GBP25m (US$35.1m) re-platforming its e-commerce business, which has taken its toll on profits. The company is looking to enhance the online experience, improve e-commerce margins, and double online sales.\nP.S: If you liked this article, you might enjoy the just-style newsletter.\nReceive our latest content delivered right to your inbox.\nLeonie Barrie,\nManaging editor\nArchroma and WWF Pakistan tackle water conservation\nPREVIOUS\nTrump goes to Davos as uncertainty abounds\nNEXT\nSectors: Apparel, Finance, Retail\nMost Popular\nInsights\nNews\nMarket research\n\nEmail Address\nPassword\n\nForgot your password?\nMenu\nLogin\nJoin\nJoin 31,000 apparel and textile professionals who get just-style’s FREE newsletters\nGet the daily news as it happens, and our weekly best-of roundup.\n\n\n\n\nDaily News Alert: see example\nWeekly Summary: see example\nApparel and textile Research Updates: see example\nWebinar & Offers Alerts:\nNo thanks\n\nBuy apparel market research\nNew apparel market research\nApparel sector market research\nApparel companies market research\nApparel market research publishers\nApparel industry consultants\nPLM software buyers' guide\nApparel industry webinars\nNews & comment by region\nYour account\nAdvertise on just-style\nSubscribe to just-style\nRSS feeds\nSite map\nAbout just-style\n©2018 All content copyright just-style.com\nPublished by Aroq Ltd.

Yes, it looks like it may be “back to the future” again, as in ... war preparation.\nThe Trump administration has revealed defence priorities that have the chilling feel of a cold war emphasis – rather than a no-war aspiration. The world has just been told that the 2019 Pentagon budget – topped up at US$716 billion – comes packaged as an “aggressive defence strategy”. Defence Secretary James “Mad Dog” Mattis, viewed as one of this bizarre administration’s more balanced brains, cites threats from China and Russia. Both political left and right, argue some US think-tank types, seem in increasing concurrence on two nostrums. One is that the Indo-Pacific region is the globe’s number one geopolitical theatre (agree). The second is that America must do much more to counter an “increasingly authoritarian, mercantilist and aggressive” China.\nWho knows what the US now wants, but what is worrisome is the ever-hovering Law of Unintended Consequences: one builds up for peace but winds up with war.\nThis depressing drift reflects conceptual minimalism – an ideology of win-lose, the default of us-vs-them, and rejection of visionary global leadership for petty policy provincialism. “America First does not mean America alone”, President Donald Trump insisted at the World Economic Forum summit in Davos, Switzerland. “When the United States grows, so does the world.” But how can that be the case if it grows small-minded?\nSmall minds tend not to beget big ideas. One of America’s great diplomats was the late George Kennan, who coined – and mostly even defined – the iconic policy of “containment” as the needed antidote to the poison of the former Soviet Union. And though Kennan’s excoriation of Soviet communism never waned one bit at Princeton University’s Woodrow Wilson School, where he retired to become an unforgettable teacher, the true genius of the containment notion was its aim: not to provoke uncertainty but offer a bedrock of predictability.\nBut when the USSR collapsed from internal decay, the simplicity of this organising idea went poof as well. One day, out of frustration, a few Washington influentials trekked to Princeton hoping the master might give birth to a new trope, as it were, to reframe US policy. But according to dinner participants (alas, I was not present), Kennan resisted the challenge with the sigh that world was exploding in too many directions for conceptual miniaturisation. At the same time Kennan, who died in 1995 aged 101, had little appetite to advise anyone to go “back to the future”.\nThe provincialism of Trump is a symptom of the current default to the past, including tariff tantrums and potential trade wars that will harm US consumers as well as foreign producers; but he is not the core cause. The new provincialism goes deep: after all, Trump’s more thoughtful predecessor preferred “leading from behind”. But whether from the back or front, Asian nations from the Philippines to Vietnam – and perhaps also Singapore and Malaysia – need the US to act with intelligence and foresight. What is needed is a committed effort to formulate a cosmopolitan internationalism, fiendishly multisided; but rarely is anything truly important easy to achieve.\n\nThe problem with the win-lose paradigm is that someone always loses; the argument for win-win is, “why risk being a loser”? It should not be hard to decide which of these two approaches offers the best odds for geopolitical and economic stability. This outlook would prove less difficult to realise were it matched by an expansive dose of cosmopolitanism from China. Americans worry – and increasingly so – that Beijing is striking a more global posture than Washington but the new “nice” hegemon profile is but a pose. One Harvard professor even titled his latest book (superb, other than the awful title): Destined for War.\nChina will stumble if it needlessly brews its own cold war rumble. Big powers advance best with little steps. This sensitive point was conveyed at Davos. Singapore’s tactful minister, Chan Chun Sing, came across as more than happy to accept China’s imaginative and ambitious New Silk Road programme as a credible potential trigger for our world economy’s “next phase of growth”. But – seemed the minister’s subtext – Beijing needs to stop scaring people in the Asian neighbourhood half out of their wits if it proposes to begin “leading from the front” with élan. Said Chan: “I can understand and I have heard theories where people are afraid, hesitant about China’s growth. But this is an important historical opportunity for China to convince the rest of the world that actually its actions have a broader perspective ... The Chinese have a saying: yi de fu ren – use your benevolence to bring about a global community.”\nThis felicitous phrase was the one trumpeted by President Xi Jinping in his Davos speech last year. The optics of the current Chinese government plumping for an expansive internationalism contrasted brilliantly – and cleverly – with the self-centred darkness of the then newly inaugurated American president.

{"title": "Why the US should be wary of Xi Jinping's power consolidation", "author": "South China Morning Post", "pub_time": "2018年3月3日", "url": "http://www.scmp.com/comment/insight-opinion/article/2135439/why-us-should-be-wary-xi-jinpings-power-consolidation", "content": "\nXi Jinping\nJames Stavridis says Xi Jinping’s power consolidation offers the possibility of a strong and stable China, but without an outlet, internal pressures may boil over or external threats such as the US may become the focus\nComments:\n\nThe last emperor of China, Pu Yi, abdicated in 1912. He was the 12th emperor of the historically important Qing dynasty, which lasted 267 years. With his departure, two millenniums of empire, usually with a single individual dominating all of China, ended. Since then, the nation has moved toward an authoritarian system under Communist Party control, but has frequently changed leaders since the death in 1976 of Mao Zedong. Over recent decades, the party has observed a limit of two five-year terms – a system that has provided reasonable stability while also allowing some level of change. That era seems to be ending.\nIn an increasingly predicted manoeuvre, the Chinese Central Committee is likely to formally abolish the term limit on presidential power, creating the conditions for the incumbent, Xi Jinping, to remain in office indefinitely. Xi will also be bringing in his long-term associate Wang Qishan as vice-president, further hampering younger officials from developing centres of political power. This has been foreshadowed for at least two years in a series of “power moves” by Xi, ranging from the harsh anti-corruption campaign (headed by the 69-year-old Wang) that eliminated many rivals, to his appearing in military garb at official events, stressing his control over the People’s Liberation Army.\nWhile Xi had already established himself as the most powerful Chinese leader since Deng Xiaoping, this latest move is still a radical change, presenting both opportunities and challenges.\nIn terms of opportunity, Xi has demonstrated that he is a competent, serious, balanced leader who has improved the economy, enhanced China’s global reach, strengthened its already significant military capability, and reduced corruption – a significant set of achievements in the public’s eyes. With his potential to rule China for another decade or longer, China will experience a steady hand on the tiller of public policy.\nXi’s popularity is already strong, and this move – at least in the short term – will enhance his already powerful public persona. Finally, the 64-year-old Xi’s presumed longevity will provide China a leader with a clear, boldly stated strategic goal for its expanding role on the global stage. He laid this out in a speech at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, roughly a year ago.\nBut there will be challenges as well. No matter how competent and effective a leader he is, Xi will be faced with several knotty problems: a badly damaged environment, a super-heated real estate market, badly skewed gender demographics (more men than women), geopolitical and international legal disputes over the South China Sea, and an ageing population. When growth begins to slow significantly, which it must over time, these irritants in the political and economic system will build up internal pressures and create political discontinuities, as they have in other authoritarian societies.\nThis presents the greatest risk for China. In the end, democracy, for all its flaws and shortcomings, is a safety valve for society when things become frustrating or go wrong – and something always goes wrong. Democracy allows the people to change leaders without bloodshed and anarchy. The Chinese people have been relatively content with their authoritarian system while hitting growth targets of 10 per cent annually, building glittering new infrastructure, moving millions out of the countryside and into the urban settings, and lifting hundreds of millions of people out of poverty. But what will happen when internal pressures grow and there is no mechanism to change leaders?\nFrom the US perspective, Xi’s consolidation of power will make China an even more formidable competitor both within East Asia and globally. Countries in the neighbourhood – most of which are US allies, partners or friends – will see a single, powerful figure at the top of the Chinese leadership structure and be more inclined to enter into cooperative agreements with what they correctly view as a stable power. Globally, over the long term, authoritarian leaders also have advantages over the revolving door of real democracy. They gather decades of experience and can develop ambitious strategic plans that they will execute themselves.\nContrast this with the US tendency to whipsaw in policy when administrations change – for example, Barack Obama and the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade agreement, followed by Donald Trump’s complete rejection of the treaty and tendency to blame China for the US’ economic problems. Washington will have to respond with an overarching strategy for dealing with China that transcends individual administrations. This will be challenging but not impossible: the idea of containment against the Soviet Union (obviously not the right approach for China) in the cold war, for example, was a consistent pillar of foreign policy for decades of presidents.\nPerhaps most worrisome is the possibility that if Xi eventually comes under serious domestic pressure, he may be inclined to create external threats to maintain his own popularity. Authoritarian leaders like Hugo Chavez in Venezuela and Vladimir Putin in Russia have done so, painting the US as a nefarious enemy. A hypernationalist turn in Beijing could lead to confrontation between the US and China, and a path towards the so-called Thucydides Trap, in which a rising power confronts an existing power – a dynamic that has led so often to war over the past 2,400 years. It will take diplomacy, economic cooperation and leadership on both sides to avoid this.\nOne of the most iconic novels in the long history of China was written in the mid-18th century: The Dream of the Red Chamber, by Cao Xueqin. It is a huge, sprawling depiction of Chinese society under the Qing dynasty, when rival families fought for power in a complex hierarchy under a powerful emperor, with a vastly changing international environment as backdrop. The lesson is that influence rooted in friendship with the emperor (who is never actually named in this dreamy novel) is fragile and uncertain. Much as in the Red Chamber, leaders in China will have to manoeuvre in a deeply complex internal world, even as China emerges as a fully formed leading actor on the global stage. This will challenge Western democracies at every level. Let us hope we are ready.\nJames Stavridis is a Bloomberg columnist.

Solange die Asiaten nicht Informationen über ihre Aktionäre vorlegten, werde Washington keine Investitionen der HNA genehmigen, sagte eine mit dem Vorgang vertraute Person der Nachrichtenagentur Reuters.\nSollten die US-Behörden tatsächlich eingreifen, wären die Investments der HNA beim US-Hedgefonds SkyBridge Capital LLC und dem in der Schweiz ansässigen Rohstoffhändler Glencore in Gefahr. Beide Deals werden derzeit von US-Behörden geprüft. SkyBridge und Glencore wollten sich zu dem Thema nicht äußern, bei HNA war zunächst niemand für eine Stellungnahme zu erreichen. Ende November hatte HNA wegen falscher und unvollständiger Angaben beim Kauf der Schweizer Flug-Cateringfirma Gategroup die Aufmerksamkeit der Schweizer Aufsichtsbehörde auf sich gezogen; im Dezember blockierte Neuseeland die Übernahme einer Tochter der Großbank Australia and New Zealand Banking Group.\nAm Freitag setzte außerdem das vierte HNA-Tochterunternehmen, der Reiseveranstalter HNA-Caissa Travel Group, innerhalb von zehn Tagen den Wertpapierhandel an der Börse aus. Hainan Airlines und Tianjin Tianhai Capital waren die ersten beiden, Bohai Capital folgte Mitte dieser Woche. Die Begründungen reichten von „großen Veränderungen“, die anstünden, bis zu „wichtigen Restrukturierungsmaßnahmen der Anlagen“.\nAußerdem will sich das Unternehmen von seinem Mehrheitsanteil an der spanischen NH Hotel Group trennen, teilte es am Freitag mit. Mehrere Banken seien damit beauftragt worden, nach Interessenten für die Hotelkette zu suchen. Die Beteiligung von 29,5 Prozent wird nach aktuellen Preisen mit rund 632 Millionen Euro bewertet.\nMehrere Nachrichtenagenturen berichteten zudem, dass HNA-Geschäftsführer Adam Tan seine Teilnahme am Weltwirtschaftsforum, der nächste Woche in Davos stattfindet, abgesagt habe. Ein Grund dafür wurde nicht genannt. Die chinesische Delegation besteht bisher aus Staatspräsident Xi Jinping, dem Vorsitzenden des E-Kommerz-Riesen Alibaba, Jack Ma, dem Präsidenten des Internet-Riesen Baidu, Zhang Yaqin, und dem Vorsitzenden des Autoherstellers Guangzhou Automobile Gruppe, Zeng Qinghong.\nC-Quadrat-Gründer Alexander Schütz: „HNA ist sehr zufrieden mit der Deutsche-Bank-Aktie“\nAm Donnerstag sagte der HNA-Vorsitzende Chen Feng in einem Interview mit Reuters, dass die Unternehmensgruppe ihre Probleme schrittweise lösen werde und man die Unterstützung der Banken und anderer Finanzinstitute habe. 2018 plane man „effizienter“ zu werden.\nDer chinesische Konzern sieht sich immer größerem Druck von sowohl staatlicher wie auch finanzieller Seite ausgesetzt: Im Sommer kritisierte die chinesische Regierung heimische Unternehmen für ihre Einkaufstouren im Ausland und nannte unter anderem auch die schuldenfinanzierten Akquisen der HNA als Negativbeispiel. Der Mischkonzern hatte in den drei Jahren zuvor Anlagen im Wert von circa 40 Milliarden US-Dollar außerhalb Chinas aufgekauft. Zum Jahresende 2017 gab es immer mehr Meldungen über Liquiditätsengpässe, ausstehende Rückzahlungen und eingefrorene Kreditlinien.\nÜber die österreichische Vermögensverwaltung C-Quadrat ist HNA mit 9,9 Prozent an der Deutschen Bank beteiligt. Die Probleme befeuerten zuletzt Spekulationen, dass die Chinesen ihren Deutsche-Bank-Anteil versilbern könnten. Doch HNA wies dies zurück. „Die Deutsche Bank ist ein Kerninvestment für HNA, die Beteiligung hat einen hohen Prestige-Faktor“, hatte der Vertreter von HNA im Aufsichtsrat, Alexander Schütz, Ende Dezember im Handelsblatt-Interview gesagt. HNA habe kein Interesse an einem Verkauf.\nDas Kommentieren dieses Artikels wurde deaktiviert.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

It offers various beverages, fast food and snacks in a space of just 12 square meters.\nFirst-time customers sign up by scanning a QR code at the entrance, choosing a password, registering their phone number and submitting a selfie. They are then admitted through a ticket gate similar to those at subway stations.\nScanning bar codes is hardly a highly skilled job and customers - honest customers - can do it just as well as any cashier. When the subsequent mobile payment is complete, another QR code is generated which allows the customer through the ticket gate and out of the store.\nDeng Jie, deputy director of the company that owns the store, described three measures that have been taken to prevent shoplifting. First, the customer's selfie is compared with the Public Security Bureau's national ID database.\nSecond, every corner of the store comes under the steely gaze of surveillance devices that never sleep.\nThird, if a customer somehow manages to escape from the store without paying, he or she receives a friendly reminder by text message requesting payment. If the warning is ignored, the customers is banned from the store and a black mark added to his or her personal credit record.\n\"The cashier-free store is the result of the coming together of new technology and consumer demand,\" Deng said. Her technical team worked on the app for over three years with 300,000 yuan ($44,000) poured into the project.\nVenture capitalists believe cashier-free stores could be \"the next big thing,\" and Deng's company plans to open 25 more this year in various parts of the country, with 200 franchised stores in Chongqing.\nEarlier this month, Alibaba opened its first brick and mortar store \"Tao Cafe\" in the company's hometown, Hangzhou, capital of East China's Zhejiang province. A long queue of curious customers soon formed.\nIn Shanghai, cashier-free stores are already a part of the landscape. BingoBox Minimarkets, 15-square-meter box, have been installed in many residential communities.\nCustomers open the door by scanning a QR code, select fresh fruit and daily necessities and check out by e-payment, pretty much a clone of the Yiqi Shan system. There will be 5,000 BingoBoxes in place by the end of August, according to the company website.\nThe focus of the retail industry is shifting from price to customer experience.\n\"'Restructuring' could become a key word for retail,\" said Zhang Yong, CEO of Alibaba. \"The flow of production, relationships between sellers and customers, and the shopping experience will be revolutionized to the extent that every customer is identified, understood and served.\"\n"}

For example, the company plans not to buy land at the open market from October, and wait for opportunities of mergers and acquisitions, he added.\n\"Third, we have strategy, and we know how to implement it,\" Sun said.\nOn July 19, Wanda signed a deal with Sunac China and Guangzhou R&F Properties in Beijing. In a joint announcement, Wanda said it would sell 77 hotels in China to Guangzhou R&F Properties for 19.9 billion yuan ($2.95 billion), and a total of 91 percent equity in 13 tourism projects to Sunac China for 43.84 billion yuan.\nEarlier this year, Sun invested 15 billion yuan and became the second-largest shareholder of Chinese tech group LeEco's listed company, Leshi Internet Information & Technology. On July 21, Sun was appointed as chairman of Leshi.\n"}

Alibaba owns the South China Morning Post.\nPwC predicts that North America will experience productivity gains earlier than China due to its first mover advantage in AI but China is expected to pull ahead of the United States in terms of AI productivity gains within 10 years after it catches up to the technology.\nAccording to the PwC research, AI is projected to boost China’s GDP by 26 per cent by 2030, while for North America the number is 14.5 per cent. For developing countries in Latin America and Africa, the expected GDP gain will only be about 6 per cent due to the much lower rates of AI technology adoption.\n“China has already made great leaps in the development of AI and our research shows that [AI] has the potential to be a powerful remedy for slowing growth,” said Chuan Neo Chong, chairwoman of Greater China operations for global consultancy Accenture.\nArtificial intelligence could put as many as 50m Asian jobs at risk over next 15-20 years: UBS study\nIn separate research done by Accenture, AI is expected to accelerate China’s annual growth rate from 6.3 per cent to 7.9 per cent by 2035. The Accenture research, published on Monday, shows that AI could boost China’s gross value added (GVA) by US$7.11 trillion by 2035 and has the potential to boost China’s labour productivity by 27 per cent by the same year.\nMinimising the economic imbalances brought about by AI will be an important challenge, said Lee Kai-fu, the former Greater China president of Google and founder of venture capital firm Sinovation Ventures.\nThose developing countries which will experience rapid population growth in coming decades are expected to be hardest hit by AI in terms job losses, he added.\n“Most of the wealth created by AI will go into the US and China because of their big pool of talent and [high levels of data generation], as well as the size of their markets,” said Li, who is one of the most prominent advocates of AI in China.\nYou are signed up.

Apple is nearly a trillion-dollar company with a cash pile bigger than General Electric and a services division the size of a Fortune 100 company. Google's search has become so dominant that it got the largest antitrust fine ever issued by the European Commission. Facebook's billions of users are now accessing essential services like voter registration and suicide prevention through the platform. Entrepreneurs like Peter Thiel and Elon Musk are household names.\nBut the technology sector's runaway growth has also earned it significant pushback. Films like \"The Circle\" and \"Ingrid Goes West\" and TV shows like \"Mr. Robot\" and \"Black Mirror,\" have depicted a burgeoning distrust of the industry. Real-life fumbles like a $400 juicer, and criticism from President Donald Trump, didn't help Silicon Valley's image.\nHere are some of the top stories that shaped the sector's year.\nJapanese billionaire Masayoshi Son ended 2016 with a proclamation that then seemed outlandish: ambitions to launch a $100 billion technology fund. The idea (plus a rich commitment to create 50,000 U.S. jobs) landed Son a meeting with then president-elect Trump.\nOutspoken venture capitalist Jason Calacanis joked that Silicon Valley start-ups were forgoing IPOs and looking to Son as their savior instead.\nA year out, however, his SoftBank Vision Fund has climbed well above the punchline.\nSoftBank has committed money toward everything from Slack to satellites to semiconductors, making giant funding rounds the \"new normal\" in Silicon Valley, even for mature companies. Nary an industry has been left untouched: insurance, ridesharing, co-working, robotics and even dog-walking.\nJust one of SoftBank's investments — a $3 billion round in WeWork — counted for 17 percent of all investment in venture-backed companies in the third quarter, according to the National Venture Capital Association and PitchBook. Each of the top 3 rounds to U.S. companies in the third quarter were made by SoftBank, according to a report from PwC and CB Insights.\nIt was the best of times, it was the worst of times.\n2017 was a year of have and have-nots among publicly traded technology companies. The so-called Big Five — Apple, Amazon, Microsoft, Facebook and Alphabet — all hit all-time high stock prices several times over in 2017, carrying the S&P technology sector beyond its previous dot-com bubble high in March 2000.\nApple, in particular, was virtually untouchable on Wall Street, reaching a valuation of almost $900 billion at one point, the highest of any publicly traded company in the world. Although the company was practically minting money, the prospects of the GOP tax reform and the launch of the much-anticipated iPhone X meant that analysts more or less overlooked Apple's major quarterly earnings reports for most of the year.\nBut investors did not extend that favor to up-and-comers like Snap, a social media darling that was expected to revive the market for technology IPOs. Shares shot up 44 percent in the March trading debut. But the stock tumbled, eventually falling below the IPO price, after disappointing quarterly earnings reports, as Facebook moved aggressively into disappearing messages and augmented reality, Snap's bread and butter.\nWhile IPOs as a whole outperformed the S&P 500 this year, other venture-backed companies didn't fare much better against the Big Five. Blue Apron shares fell as low as $2.94 a share from a high of $11, as Amazon plunged headfirst into the grocery business with its purchase of Whole Foods. Stitch Fix was a rare bright spot, so far up 43 percent so far this month as of Wednesday's close.\n\"2017 has definitely been a very subdued year for IPOs,\" EquityZen CEO Atish Davda told CNBC's \"Closing Bell.\" \"People were expecting a roaring IPO year out of the gate.\"\nWhile wide-eyed consumers watched dark shows like \"Stranger Things\" and \"Black Mirror,\" executives were agonizing over a much scarier task — writing $1 billion checks.\nNetflix said in October it expects to spend up to $8 billion in 2018 on content, $1 billion more than previously planned, amid an uptick in subscribers. Netflix — alongside rivals like YouTube, HBO Now and Hulu — is consistently among the top-grossing apps in the App Store.\nThat left rivals with a choice: Beat 'em or join 'em.\nDisney was the highest-profile detractor, announcing in August that it would pull all its movies from Netflix and stand-alone video streaming services. And CEO Bob Iger wasted no time after the move was set in motion, agreeing to buy many parts of Twenty-First Century Fox for $52.4 billion in stock. Combined, the companies present a portfolio that includes \"Star Wars\" and \"The Simpsons.\"\nThe competition for Netflix didn't stop there, as more and more companies have dabbled in \"original content,\" among them Facebook, Apple and Snap.\nIndeed, CEO Reed Hastings said, the market for content is so vast that the real competition for Netflix is sleep.\nAs Intel's 50th birthday approaches, the predictions of the company's co-founder, Gordon Moore, still echo.\nMoore forecast explosive advancement as chipmakers put more and more components on smaller and smaller chips. But his namesake law came to be seen as a death knell for the semiconductor industry, with observers predicting that Moore's law had met its limits over the past five years.\nBut somehow, the semiconductor industry hasn't withered — indeed, it flourished this year.\nIf the tech industry has had a good year on Wall Street, the semiconductor field has had a better one. While the Technology Select Sector ETF is up 31.7 percent over the past year as of Wednesday's close, the iShares Semiconductor ETF and VanEck Vectors Semiconductor ETF are up more than 35 percent (both chip groups hit all-time highs at the end of November). Nvidia shares rose more than 80 percent over the past year, despite its triple-digit 2016 surge.\nAnalog Devices CEO Vincent Roche writes that the industry has been transformed by the fluid exchange of data between computing systems and the cloud, and by new business models of manufacturing. While PC sales are deflating, self-driving cars are putting the semiconductor industry on pace for its best year ever, according to electronics trade magazine EE Times.\nConsumers are also playing a big role. AMD CEO Lisa Su told CNBC that gaming consoles, new Apple computers, and mining cryptocurrencies all have helped AMD's business. On Black Friday, she said, sales of AMD's Ryzen processors tripled from the previous year on Amazon and electronics retailing site Newegg.\nAnd semiconductor companies are fighting hard for their share of the upside. Qualcomm is waging a battle against Apple on one hand, while it is embroiled in talks of a megamerger with Broadcom. Toshiba and Western Digital spent most of the year battling over chips, too. And some of Silicon Valley's top minds have abandoned big companies in search of the perfect AI chip.\nOnlookers gave Uber a hard look this year amid sexual harassment allegations. That scrutiny uncovered deeper issues within the company that ultimately led to the departure of major executives and two prominent board members.\nEven before former employee Susan Fowler posted a February blog entry about her negative experiences as a woman at Uber, the company was under a microscope.\nThe FTC fined Uber $20 million in January for misleading potential drivers. Critics on social media accused the ride-hailing company in January of undercutting taxi drivers protesting a controversial immigration policy enacted by Trump. Though Uber denounced the Trump travel ban, the company had already been criticized for \"collaborating\" with the president through Trump's Strategic and Policy Forum.\nThen-Uber CEO Travis Kalanick stepped back from the president's council and pledged money toward fighting the travel ban. But that didn't stop the #deleteUber trend from taking off on social media.\nFowler's allegations fueled the fire. She wrote that her manager propositioned her, that complaints were consistently dismissed by human resources, and that even tasks like ordering branded leather jackets devolved into \"comically absurd\" diatribes on gender. February also marked the beginning of a vicious legal battle between Uber and Alphabet's Waymo over self-driving cars.\nThe bad news kept coming, including reports that Uber mishandled of a rape victim's medical records, allowed drug use at company events, and designed programs to mislead regulators. Other executives were also accused of misconduct, especially after a video in which Kalanick berated a driver. One executive was accused of sexual harassment at a previous job, others leased out cars that caught fire, and yet others took staffers to an escort bar, reports said.\nMore than 20 staff members were fired as part of an internal investigation. Regulators also stepped in to investigate some of the claims against Uber.\nKalanick and his top deputies ultimately resigned, as did board members David Bonderman and Bill Gurley, amid a lawsuit among several top investors. New CEO Dara Khosrowshahi revealed in the fall that a 2016 data breach affecting 57 million people had also been concealed by Uber.\nThe odds are pretty good that at least some of the private personal data you held dear at the start of 2017 is now in the hands of hackers — and the emails of some of the country's most prominent figures are, too.\nDays before November 2016's presidential election, then-FBI Director James Comey announced the examination of new emails related to Hillary Clinton's personal email server.\nCritics of the then-Democratic presidential candidate said her server was a cybersecurity risk and that she mishandled classified information. Clinton's proponents have pointed to the hacking of the Democratic National Committee's emails as Russian interference in the election, a debate that would continue into the new year.\nIn December 2016, consumers learned that more than 1 billion Yahoo users had their information stolen by hackers more than three years earlier. (Just a few months before the December announcement, Yahoo had disclosed a 2014 hack that affected 500 million user accounts).\nEnter 2017.\nIn September, credit reporting firm Equifax revealed a breach exposing sensitive information of more than 145 million Americans — nearly half the country's population.\nHackers gained access to birth dates, Social Security numbers, credit card numbers, driver's license numbers and addresses. Several Equifax executives have since left the company, appeared before Congress and become the focus of federal investigations.\nOnce a leading internet company, Yahoo joined AOL atVerizon in June, and Yahoo chief executive Marissa Mayer exited the company. But the deal price was slashed by $350 million after the disclosure of the data breaches.\nBy October, Yahoo clarified the extent of previously reported hacks, and consumers learned that 3 billion users had been affected by its data breach — that's every single Yahoo user that existed in 2013.\nAnd in November, Uber disclosed a hack affecting 57 million users and drivers on the pioneering ride-hailing app — a breach that the company had previously acted to cover up. The 2016 breach, performed by just two men, exposed the names, driver's license numbers, email addresses and phone numbers of both riders and drivers.\nThe year's stories about Russian-backed political ads — and other unsavory advertising practices — hit Facebook's reputation as the social network for friends and family.\nAfter governmental inquiries, CEO Mark Zuckerberg was forced to apologize for saying the company could not have swung the presidential election. Facebook acknowledged at least 150 million Americans on Facebook and Instagram saw ads intended to influence the 2016 U.S. election bought by Russian groups. As a result, Congress has introduced proposals that could bring more scrutiny on Facebook, as well as other online companies.\nOther troubling ad issues plagued the company, including allegations that its ad-targeting technology allows companies to racially discriminate and use derogatory terms to find potential customers. Facebook announced in September it would block ad targeting based on derogatory terms, and vowed to add more human reviewers to oversee the business.\nOn top of that, the company walked back a plan to change its ownership structure. Initially, the company proposed allowing Zuckerberg to sell millions of his shares but still have voting control. But shareholders filed a class-action lawsuit — and eventually, Facebook's proposal was withdrawn.\nBut perhaps worst of all for users? The company admitted in December that using the platform could be bad for your mental health under some circumstances. The study came after early investors, executives, and advertisers all commented publicly about Facebook's approach to mental health or addiction over the course of the year.\nUber whistleblower Fowler was one of the first in a series of sexual harassment allegations that became public in the business community in 2017. There had long been a \"whisper network\" among women in technology-related fields, and complaints from women like Ellen Pao had made headlines in the past.\nBut 2017 brought a new rawness to technology industry's gender imbalance.\nVenture investors like Chris Sacca and Dave McClure were accused of sexism, and McClure resigned from 500 Startups, a tech incubator he co-founded. Binary Capital partner Justin Caldbeck also resigned after he was accused of making advances toward six businesswomen.\nStill, the departure of many offenders did not leave Silicon Valley with a clean slate.\nGoogle engineer James Damore penned an extensive document on the left-leaning culture of the company, using the biological differences in sexes as evidence that diversity training may have gone too far.\nGoogle fired Damore, but he remains a divisive figure and a personification of the discord within technology companies.\nThe world ushered in its new richest man, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, in 2017 — and it truly seemed like there was nothing he couldn't do.\nTake it from Netflix, which competes with Amazon in streaming content:\n\"They are so scary,\" CEO Reed Hastings told CNBC. \"Everything Amazon does is so amazing. How are they doing so many business areas so well? We are continuing to watch them and be impressed with them.\"\n\"They are awfully scary, I would say,\" he added.\nYou don't have to tell CVS and Aetna twice: The drugstore and health insurer agreed to merge this year, a $69 billion deal some say was motivated by Amazon's eye on the prescription drug market.\nAmazon's June agreement to purchase of Whole Foods took the world by surprise, but plenty of other milestones didn't.\nIts e-commerce business posted its best \"Prime Day,\" Cyber Monday and holiday season ever. And Amazon's dominance of the cloud industry continued, as Amazon Web Services snagged clients like Turner, Expedia, Disney and the NFL.\nNot to mention a rush of new hardware inspired by the almost instant ubiquity of smart voice assistant Alexa. A couple of them — including the Amazon Fire HD 10 tablet and the Echo Spot — were among our favorite products of the year.\nYou probably know by now that bitcoin is on a ridiculous run this year, up 15-fold as of Wednesday, even after tumbling to $15,000 from its recent high of over $19,000. It's the digital asset that nobody knows how to value and, depending on who you believe, will either trade down to zero or reach $1 million by 2020.\nBut 2017 wasn't just about bitcoin. It was the year we learned all about ethereum, another blockchain-based platform that has its own skyrocketing cryptocurrency (up almost 100-fold in 2017). And there's this crazy thing about ethereum — it enables the creation of tons of new and niche cryptocurrencies, whether for buying and selling cloud storage, sharing virtual reality content, facilitating cannabis transactions or letting people get paid for offering up results of DNA tests.\nAccording to research firm Autonomous Next, crypto projects raised over $3 billion this year in so-called initial coin offerings, up from just $222 million in 2016. Some start-ups raised tens or hundreds of millions of dollars in a matter of hours, with only a white paper, a following on chat app Telegram and the promise of building some wild new network.\nThe regulators have started hovering. China and South Korea have cracked down on ICOs, while the U.S. SEC has put the kibosh on some offerings and made clear that it won't stand for unregulated sales of securities.\nDespite the volatility and many other risks that come with new forms of digital money, talk to a cryptocurrency enthusiast and you may come away convinced that decentralized currencies that are not reliant on the availability of dollars and euros, and that don't get revalued based on the whims of certain governments and strength or weaknesses of various economies, are a global inevitability.\nIf you're not careful, you may even start using the phrase, \"internet of money.\"\n— CNBC staff contributed to this report.\nDisclosure: Comcast, which owns CNBC parent NBCUniversal, is a co-owner of Hulu.\n"}

We expect another double-digit growth in China in 2018,” he added.\nChina’s chocolate industry witnessed a slight rise in sales recently (2% value growth in 2017) thanks to the improvement of the national economy and consumers’ rising disposable income, according to Euromonitor.\nDuring the six-year period (2012 to 2017), the sales value of China’s chocolate increased from 15bn RMB ($2.3bn) to 20bn RMB ($3.1bn).\nHowever, Barry Callebaut says chocolate consumption in China still has “plenty of room to grow.”\n“China is still an emerging market, but it is one of our fastest growing markets in Asia Pacific, especially for our gourmet products. Today it is one of our top five gourmet markets in the world,” said De Schryver.\nWhat makes Barry Callebaut confident about the outlook of China’s chocolate market is more than just its sheer size, the company said.\n“China is also the largest and the most innovative e-commerce market in the world,” De Schryver told ConfectioneryNews. “It helps that China e-commerce sites are driven by content, participation by key influencers and fulfillment managed by huge distribution channels.”\n“We are already seeing the rapid growth of sales of our chocolate products on our online platforms. We are expanding our presence and content in Tmall ( 天猫) to other popular e-commerce and social media sites including JD.com ( 京 东), XiaChuFang ( 下厨房), XiaoHongShu ( 小 红书), and WeChat ( 微信),” he added.\nThese channels have helped Barry Callebaut reach customers beyond tier-one cities (Shanghai, Beijing and Guangzhou), doubling its online sales in China in the last 12 months, the company said.\nWhile some of the biggest western brands – Mars, Ferrero and Nestlé – account for the majority share of China’s chocolate market, local producers are showing stronger interest in collaborating with Barry Callebaut.\n“We’ve observed that domestic chocolate producers are more willing today to be more innovative (co-creation of new products) and prepared to focus on their core competencies, thus even ready to outsource chocolate production to Barry Callebaut,” said De Schryver.\nBarry Callebaut chose Shanghai as the venue for its global launch of Ruby Chocolate in September 2017, which was first adopted by Nestlé Japan’s KitKat recently.\nCopyright - Unless otherwise stated all contents of this web site are © 2018 - William Reed Business Media Ltd - All Rights Reserved - Full details for the use of materials on this site can be found in the Terms & Conditions\nRelated topics: Markets, Candy, Emerging Markets, Cocoa & Sugar\nShow more\nFree newsletter Subscribe Sign up to our free newsletter and get the latest news sent direct to your inbox\n"}

The statement said the news report was issued with ill intent.\nBowen Press could not be immediately reached for comment.\nWanda, which has spent billions buying entertainment and sports companies in recent years, has become a target in China's clampdown on capital outflows, and sources say Chinese banks have been told to stop providing funding for several of its overseas acquisitions in order to curb its appetite for offshore deals.\n\nShares of Wang's Wanda Hotel Development slid as much as 11 percent but pared the declines and were down 4.6 percent by 0415 GMT.

But the long-term lessons of that seminal event appear lost on Beijing\nBy Rana Mitter\n0 Share\nOn May 30, 1925, thirteen Chinese workers in British-controlled Shanghai were shot dead. Shortly afterwards, Guangzhou and Hong Kong were paralysed by a 16-month-long strike and boycott of British goods by Chinese workers in both cities, protesting at the deaths of their countrymen. The British authorities had to provide a multimillion-dollar payment to prevent the local economy from collapsing. At a time when China was horribly oppressed by Western powers, the boycott was one of the few effective ways in which a weaker power could show its strength against a stronger one.\nIn the past few days, there has been an echo of 1925; Chinese authorities have encouraged a boycott of South Korean goods and shops in China. The overall effect is very different from that in 1925, however, because this time, it looks like a big, powerful country taking out its resentment on a smaller power that refuses to do what it is told.\nThe immediate cause of China’s anger is South Korea’s decision to deploy the Terminal High-Altitude Area Defence system (THAAD), designed to guard against incoming North Korean missiles, but which China fears is aimed at spying on Beijing’s defensive capacity. In response, China’s authorities have made an increasingly wide range of gestures against South Korea, first banning Korean soap opera and pop stars from Chinese airwaves, then making it harder for Chinese tourists to visit Seoul. By making such gestures, Beijing is of course tacitly admitting that Korea has what China lacks, but desperately wants: genuine soft power.\nNow, Chinese consumers are being encouraged to boycott Korean goods and shops in China itself. Already, there are reports of supermarkets owned by the Korean company Lotte being deserted by their customers.\nChina’s actions come at a time of huge weakness in South Korea. The fall of President Park Geun-hye in a corruption scandal has meant that a victory for the leftist Democratic Party, which seemed unfeasible just a year ago, is now the most likely result in May’s presidential election. Moon Jae-in, now heading towards the top job, would probably have taken a more conciliatory line towards China anyway, which makes this a puzzling time for China to pressure its politicians over THAAD.\nIn 1996, Beijing’s threats to attack Taiwan if the self-governing island re-elected then-president Lee Teng-hui backfired – he was returned with a greater majority. Likewise, South Koreans may be disgusted with the Park regime, but threats from China are unlikely to make an anti-THAAD candidate any more appealing to them.\nThe boycott is particularly puzzling because it does greatest harm in the long term not to South Korea’s economy, but to China’s careful diplomatic attempts to portray itself as a cooperative and valued neighbour.\nIn the past few years, China and South Korea had created a relationship that showed a country could have a meaningful economic and cultural relationship with China as well as a security relationship with the United States. China’s friendship with Seoul was reciprocated; Park even appeared alongside President Xi Jinping ( 習近平 ) at the 2015 military parade in Beijing. However, the two countries eventually parted ways when it came to the ever-more urgent problem of North Korea, which has South Korea and Japan in its sights.\nChina has tried to maintain the position that it has little influence on the maverick nation, even though active involvement in de-nuclearising the Pyongyang regime would do wonders for China’s image as a peacemaker as well as killing the justification for THAAD stone-dead. Although it has imposed mild sanctions on North Korea’s economy, Beijing seems to have reserved its real anger for the South.\nChina has a right to a leading role in Asia. But that role must be earned through persuasion and cooperation, and not asserted by the use of economic force by a stronger power against a weaker one. Many observers were deeply impressed by the commitment made by Xi at Davos just two months ago to oppose protectionism and encourage free and open trade at a time when the US seems to be turning against the idea. But boycotting goods from another country for political reasons is not free trade.\nHistory should also give Beijing pause for thought. In the short term, the 1925 boycott faded away. But the resentment lasted and simmered. Anger at the treatment of China’s workers by Western powers created the conditions for the rise of the Nationalist party, or Kuomintang, and then the Communists under Mao Zedong (毛澤東). In the short term, the boycott of Korean goods may achieve policy gains for China. But Beijing may find that in the longer term, it is in danger of severely damaging its attempts to portray itself as a cool-headed, trusted power in the region. ■\nRana Mitter is director of the University China Centre at the University of Oxford\nRana Mitter\nAsian insights and analysis direct to your inbox.\nBy registering to our newsletter you agree to our T&C and Privacy Policy\nRelated topics\nNewsletter Signup\nAsian insights and analysis direct to your inbox.\nBy registering to our newsletter you agree to our T&C and Privacy Policy\nLatest Issue\nChina\nAsia\nCopyright © 2018 South China Morning Post Publishers Ltd.

Half the users spend more than 90 minutes a day on its chat app, according to WeChat.\nWeChat's push on these nimble mini-apps comes as Google this week launched its own Android Instant Apps, which don't require downloading and are available on certain Android devices, though access to Google products in China is heavily restricted.\nWeChat says there are about 200,000 third-party developers for the WeChat platform.\n\"A very strong trend in China is that demand for iOS and Android apps is waning, while that for programme developing based on WeChat is rising,\" said Leon Du, co-founder of Guangzhou-based Beansmile, a digital consultancy that develops apps and websites.\nHelped by WeChat-based advertising and payment-related services, Tencent this week reported its\nhighest profit growth in three years\nfor the first quarter.\nWhile Tencent doesn't release data on the number of mini-programs available, Dong Xu, a manager at market data firm Analysys, says her interviews with businesses suggest the adoption rate has so far been modest.\n\"Mini-programs are mainly used for low-frequency, offline scenarios, such as fee payments, parking, and customer inquiries,\" Dong said. \"Users' in-depth needs such as entertainment and e-commerce still take place with apps.\"\nThird-party developers say the mini-programs, built in WeChat's proprietary programming language, are less data-heavy and easier to develop than their iOS or Android counterparts.\nUsers, for example, can tap a programme on a restaurant's official WeChat account to order food, have it delivered to their table and pay for it, all in one app.\nWeChat also last month quietly established a new department dedicated to online searching, and this week rolled out a beta search-engine box with enhanced power, revealing its ambition to take on rival Baidu Inc.\nCentral to its plans for an expansive and dynamic app ecosystem is the development of WeChat's own payment infrastructure.\nAround 300 developers work for WeChat Pay, which competes with Alipay, run by Alibaba affiliate Ant Financial, and to a lesser extent, Apple Pay, which launched in China last year.\nTenPay, which runs WeChat Pay and Tencent's smaller QQ Wallet, is China's most popular mobile payment provider by users, with 838 million users dwarfing Alipay's 432 million, according to Analysys.\nAt a post-earnings conference call on Wednesday, Tencent President Martin Lau flagged WeChat Pay's goal to permeate all aspects of consumer life in China.\nFor Apple, which wants to deepen its reach in China, the world's biggest mobile spender, WeChat's large and loyal fan base and its payment service present a challenge.\nChina overtook the United States as the biggest contributor to Apple's iOS app store revenue last year, according to mobile data analytics firm App Annie. However, Apple's Greater China revenue dropped 14 percent in the first three months of the year, as cheaper rivals chipped away at sales.\nApple declined to comment for this article.\nLast month, some Chinese WeChat fans threatened to ditch Apple products after the U.S. firm forced the chat app to abolish a popular tipping function.\nWhile building user loyalty is a core part of both Apple's and WeChat's strategies, Zhang Ying, general manager of WeChat Pay, has downplayed product tensions from the tipping spat.\n\"Apple is still supportive of the [WeChat] ecosystem. We are part of the [Apple] ecosystem,\" he told a forum in Hong Kong last month.\n\"It is far from a 'choose-one-or-another' - it's merely some disagreement.\"\n\nPlaying\nShare this video...\nWatch Next...\n"}

Its chief executive officer, Ivan Glasenberg, also resigned from Rusal’s board.\nThe impact of Friday’s sanctions reverberated through commodities markets. Aluminium extended its biggest two-day gain in more than six years on concern production from Rusal will be prevented from reaching global markets.\nUS President Donald Trump’s threat to respond “forcefully” to a chemical weapons attack in Syria over the weekend added fuel to the fire because he has suggested that Putin may have had a hand in the incident. The White House said Tuesday that Trump was contemplating a military response.\nThe rouble depreciated 4.3 per cent to 63.275 versus the dollar, taking its decline this week to 8.1 per cent. Russian stocks rose 3.9 per cent, partly reversing an 8.3 per cent slide on Monday, mostly because other non-sanctioned exporters benefit from the weaker currency since their earnings are in dollars and costs are in roubles.\nRussia promises ‘tough response’ after US slaps sanctions on more oligarchs\n“My sense, is that economically at least, Russia is outgunned and they will seek to save face and not exacerbate the situation,” said Julian Rimmer, a London-based emerging-markets trader at Investec Bank. “My advice to clients, therefore, is to buy shares into this weakness, especially Sberbank, and hold onto your shapka.”\nRussia’s economic retaliation options are limited. If it were to take aim at US companies, that would hurt its access to technology and investment at a time when Putin is trying to attract it, Alexei Kudrin, a former Russian finance minister, told reporters in Moscow on Tuesday.\n\nWhat Russia can afford to do is contain the damage – it has US$458 billion of international reserves, the most since 2014. The central bank said Tuesday that it won’t hesitate to sell dollars if needed.\nPolicymakers, who’ve cut borrowing costs for months, can also use interest rates to offset any increase in inflation, Governor Elvira Nabiullina said at a conference in Moscow.\nWhen the rouble went into free-fall in December 2014, she did just that – hoisting the key rate by 650 basis points overnight in a move that eventually calmed market panic.\nThe turmoil comes less than two months after S&P Global Ratings reinstated Russia’s investment-grade standing, prompting huge inflows.\nBut the tables turned against Russia quickly in recent weeks since the UK accused the country of poisoning an ex-spy on British soil. Britain and allies including the US have expelled more than 150 Russian diplomats.\n\nIt took the sanctions to really rattle investor confidence, though. Yields on government rouble-denominated debt due in January 2028 surged 27 basis points to 7.59 per cent on Tuesday.\nIn addition to the cancelled Finance Ministry auction, Sberbank postponed a local bond sale because of the “negative market dynamic.”\nThe penalties have “introduced an enormous amount of unpredictability from the US authorities as to the future trajectory of the sanctions, whom they’re going to target and the nature of the sanctions that they’re going to use,” said Paul Greer, a London-based money manager at Fidelity International, which reduced its holdings in Russian bonds in early March.\nYou are signed up.

The report did not give any further details.\n\nBut two US sources familiar with the discussion said Washington was in no hurry for those talks to take place.\n“There is a restriction on sending secretaries to China as the US suspended the CED since last year,” one source said. The other said “junior” officials – deputy or assistant secretaries at most – could visit Beijing for such talks.\nPeople’s Daily reported that Liu had “candid and constructive” talks with US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer, a hardliner on trade with China, and Trump’s top economic aide Gary Cohn.\nCohn resigned from the White House on Tuesday after disagreeing with the Trump administration’s plan to impose tariffs on steel and aluminium imports.\nChina ‘doesn’t want a trade war’ with US, as sides agree to more talks in Beijing soon\nBesides concerns about China’s trade surplus with the US, there has long been criticism in Washington of Beijing’s reluctance to further open up its markets, big state subsidies for Chinese companies and demands that technology be transferred in exchange for access to the Chinese market.\n“The time for promises is over,” one source said, adding that concrete actions, such as unilateral reform to open up market access and level the playing field for foreign companies operating in China, was the only way for China to “prove its sincerity”.\nThe government work report delivered by Premier Li Keqiang on Monday at the opening session of the annual meeting of the National People’s Congress in Beijing largely reiterated the commitment to opening up announced in November and offered no clues of new measures that would “exceed expectations” promised by Liu in Davos in January.\n\nThe latest US national security and defence strategy listed China as a “strategic rival” and called for strong economic, military and technological responses to confront it.\n“These strategic concerns are now slowly translating into concrete policies,” Arthur Kroeber, the research head of China-focused research firm Gavekal Dragonomics, said in a report this month.\nFollowing a US investigation of China’s industrial policies and technology trade practices, there has been widespread speculation that US President Donald Trump’s trade actions will soon be narrowed to focus on China.\nWhy China’s top economic adviser Liu He could be next central bank chief\nPossible sanctions include tariffs on many Chinese goods, penalties on Chinese firms, and restrictions on Chinese technology investment and the export of hi-tech products.\n“The alliance of trade and security hardliners is pushing for the US to engage in a sort of economic or technological cold war with China, where the aim is not to negotiate for mutual advantage, but to punish and diminish the enemy,” Kroeber said.\nYou are signed up.

The Arctic and Latin America were last week added to the mammoth infrastructure, development and trade drive, leaving the United States, Canada, Japan and India as the only major economies not to join.\nThe initial idea of linking China to Europe and Africa through land and sea routes has got ever-more ambitious, despite the challenges. But grounded in a philosophy of nations cooperating for mutual benefit, there is no better strategy for worldwide growth, peace and stability.\nChina-led bank spreads its wings to Africa, South America to bankroll infrastructure projects\nSuch a vision requires leadership and China has shown that at a time that the US has turned inward-looking under President Donald Trump. That was evident at the recent World Economic Forum in Davos, where the belt and road was the focus of speeches and meetings involving Chinese officials and the American leader earned scorn for sending mixed signals on free trade and globalisation.\nAs leading businesspeople and politicians gathered, Foreign Minister Wang Yi invited Latin American and Caribbean officials meeting in Chile to join the initiative. Beijing, releasing a policy document on the Arctic four days later, unveiled plans for a “Polar Silk Road” linking China with Europe and the Atlantic.\nWhy China is running into political potholes on its ‘New Silk Road’\nMaking such pronouncements is one matter; putting in place the conditions to enable them to happen is quite another. That is especially so when it comes to the Arctic, which will need massive investment in infrastructure like ports, roads, railways and power plants to enable trade and development.\nThe summer melting of ice as a result of global warming has spurred Beijing through allowing a faster sea route to Europe and the eastern Americas than the Indian Ocean and Panama Canal. There is also now an opportunity to exploit rich oil and gas reserves believed to lie beneath the seabed.\nHow much support China has for the idea has yet to be gauged and many obstacles lie ahead. But there has so far been great enthusiasm for the belt and road scheme, with more than 100 countries and international organisations having already joined.\nSince first being put forward by Xi during a visit to Kazakhstan in 2013, scores of projects involving more than US$300 billion in investment have been launched and Beijing plans to allocate US$1 trillion in the coming decade. Japan and Canada have unsurprisingly expressed an interest in getting involved, but Trump has yet to respond to an invitation and India refuses to sign on.\nThe danger in the deep near China’s multibillion-dollar port in Pakistan\nCountries that eye China’s growing power warily are bound to be cautious or even critical. Realising the plans will also not be easy. But Beijing has the resources and know-how, will and determination. By working together for a shared vision, all nations will benefit.\nYou are signed up.

Hong Kong will continue to play a vital role [in which it] is difficult to be replaced,” the chief of the National People’s Congress said in Beijing’s Great Hall of the People.\n“In the nation’s development, we will always need Hong Kong and [will] help the city in making accomplishments.”\nZhang was addressing a Belt and Road forum organised by the Hong Kong government and the Belt and Road General Chamber of Commerce, founded by Hong Kong and mainland businesspeople. The “Belt and Road Initiative” is the central government’s plan to boost trade in neighbouring Asian countries and beyond.\nZhang expressed four hopes for Hong Kong – that it would focus on the nation’s needs and take the initiative in matching national development strategies; play to its strengths as it cooperates with the mainland; promote innovation; and foster exchanges between Belt and Road countries.\nHe said while he recognised the Hong Kong government’s efforts in leading the city to take part in the Belt and Road plan, “it, together with various sectors, needs to have a deeper understanding of the national development strategies ... and improve its communication mechanisms with mainland authorities”.\nLau Siu-kai, vice-chairman of the Chinese Association of Hong Kong and Macau Studies, a semi-official think tank, said Zhang’s optimism was consistent with Beijing’s stance that Hong Kong would have a bright future under China’s strategies.\n“The central government is still a bit worried about Hong Kong’s [economic] future ... from their perspective, that will depend on whether the city can make use of and contribute under the Belt and Road Initiative,” he said.\nUnder President Xi Jinping, Beijing has revamped its economic diplomacy with the launch of the modern-day Silk Road trade strategy. The initiative was launched in 2013 to promote infrastructure projects in about 65 countries from Asia to Europe.\nClosing his 30-minute speech, Zhang said: “Looking back at the 40 magnificent years after the country has opened up, we have not forgotten ... that Hong Kong has played a unique role.”\nSpeaking at the same event, Chief Executive Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor said the city would continue to strengthen its ties with the mainland and its foreign trading partners.\n“Hong Kong needs to strengthen its existing advantages and explore new ones,” she said.\n“I am pleased that the proactive approach of the current administration, in integrating with the national development strategies, has been widely recognised.”\nOn Friday, Hong Kong was ranked the world’s freest economy for the 24th straight year by the Heritage Foundation, a ­Washington think tank.\nBut Lam said the city would not be complacent.\nUsing a Chinese idiom, she added: “As I said in my inaugural speech ... the competitiveness of a place is like rowing a boat against the current. You fall behind if you don’t strive to go forward.”\nLam’s and Zhang’s words came at a time of fraught relations between the mainland and parts of Hong Kong society. The local government recently struck an agreement under which the central government will lease part of an under-construction high-speed rail terminal in the city. The lease will allow mainland officials to enforce mainland laws in Hong Kong, to the outrage of pro-democracy legislators. The government still needs the Legislative Council’s approval for the full plan.\nMinisters have also contended with a small but vocal movement for the city to break away from the mainland, with pro-independence banners and fliers emerging on school and university campuses. The government last month disqualified an activist from a Legco by-election because of her advocacy of the city’s “self-determination”.\nYou are signed up. We think you'd also like\n"}

The site now known as 5 World Trade Center remains vacant amid the redevelopment of lower Manhattan’s business district.\nWanda’s plans for New York included a five-star hotel, department store and condos (Rendering by Kohn Pedersen Fox via newyorkyimby.com)\nAlthough Wanda never closed on its planned acquisition of the New York site, the developer was confident enough of its prospects in the US at the time to commission a design for a 1,050 foot tower split between 240 hotel rooms, a department store and condominiums.\nKohn Pedersen Fox, which also designed Wanda’s One Nine Elms project in London, had sketched out a seven story atrium for Wang Jianlin’s first real estate foothold in the US. The 1.4 million square foot project would have provided 350,000 square feet of hotel space, 200,000 square feet of retail and 850,000 square feet of residential.\nIn what was perhaps a signal of frustrations with the New York project, Wang complained at the World Economic Forum in Davos in 2014 that, “If we compare [the United States and the European Union], the U.S. is more open than the EU,” he said. “But the U.K. is the most open,” according to an account by CNN.\nWanda’s failure to crack the NYC market presaged the collapse of its global dreams (Rendering by Kohn Pedersen Fox via newyorkyimby.com)\nDespite Wang’s US whining, Wanda went on to sign deals for projects in Chicago and Los Angeles. Those investments, like most of Wanda’s overseas projects now are either extinct or on the endangered list.\nIn January Wanda sold off for an undisclosed sum a pair of projects in Australia that it had once valued at $1.5 billion.

Geely and Fosun offer a clue\nThe main reason for the drop was a decline in Chinese investment in the US to US$29 billion from US$46 billion the year before. The drop would have been even steeper if it wasn’t for the US$18 billion in Chinese acquisitions announced in 2016 but completed last year, the report said.\nAmerican investment into China was almost unchanged at US$14 billion compared with US$13.8 billion in 2016.\nBeijing imposed a slew of new restrictions on outbound investment last year to address balance-of-payment concerns and minimise risks to the financial system stemming from debt-fuelled overseas spending.\nIn February China’s top economic planner published a list of “sensitive areas” where it intends to restrict overseas investments, putting a specific curb on deals related to property, hotels, cinemas, entertainment and sports clubs. Weapons development, manufacturing and maintenance, multinational water resources exploitation, and news media were also included on the list.\nChina’s biggest overseas acquirers to face tightened deal scrutiny by Beijing\nHowever, despite Beijing’s best efforts to contain investment flowing into these industries, the sectors that received the most Chinese FDI last year were real estate and hospitality (US$11 billion), transport and infrastructure (US$ 10 billion), and health and biotech (US$ 2.5 billion), according to another report compiled by the Rhodium Group released this week.\nChris Marlin, president of Florida-based Lennar International, which claims to be the US’ largest residential property developer by revenue, said his firm has been unaffected by Beijing’s capital outflow controls.\nThe company has “only experienced growth in our time dealing with [customers in] mainland China and the Asian region,” said Marlin, declining to give numbers.\nIncreased scrutiny of inbound deals by US authorities had also had an impact on FDI, the research found. The biggest such deal to fall through was aluminium giant China Zhongwang Holdings’ proposed US$2.3 billion acquisition of Aleris in November after regulators cancelled it over economic and national security concerns.\nIn terms of FDI flowing the other way, the report argues that China’s commitment to further market reforms is less certain now than it was in the years immediately after the 2013 “third plenum” talks in which the leadership promised a “decisive” role for markets in the economy. A perceived lack of progress in implementing change has left potential foreign investors with doubts about Beijing’s seriousness about levelling the playing field for non-native businesses, it said.\n“To date, even as hundreds of thousands Chinese receive paychecks from US companies, numerous sectors in China remain closed or restricted to foreign investment,” said Stephen Orlins, president of the National Committee on US-China Relations.\n“These restrictions do a disservice to the overwhelming majority of China’s people, as they not only drive up prices but also limit consumer choices. These restrictions contribute to a view in the US that China does not play fair.”\nThe report’s release coincides with the Boao Forum in the Chinese province of Hainan – known as China’s Davos – at which President Xi Jinping reiterated his commitment to opening markets and easing restrictions on foreign investment.\nOn Wednesday China’s central bank unveiled a raft of measures to open up the country’s financial sector to foreign investment, including the removal of foreign ownership caps for banks. Other key measures included allowing overseas investors to take a maximum 51 per cent equity stake in brokerage firms, futures companies and fund managers and completely removing caps on foreign equity in these sectors within three years.\nYou are signed up.

When Principle premiered at the HKRep Black Box Theatre in 2017, all 14 shows were sold out. For this season, playwright Ivan Kwok continues to refine his script with Fong Chun Kit retooling the production and directing a new cast, as the audience embarks again on a journey pondering the true meaning of education and justice.

For this revival, Octavian Chan directs on our Main Stage, where audiences face the quandary of balancing justice and mercy.

The playwright of Marriage, Hashida Sugako, has received numerous accolades for such masterpieces as Oshin, Wataru Seken wa oni Bakari and Akai Giwaku, all of which have moved countless audiences. The 2015 premiere of the HKRep production of Marriage received 11 nominations at the Hong Kong Drama Awards, winning in such categories as Best Actress (Tragedy/Drama), Best Set Design, Best Costume Design, Best Lighting Design and Top Ten Popular Productions.

Jason and Tanya have fallen in love, yet cannot move forward together. Jason's life is at a stalemate: his feet cannot touch ground, his body afloat and directionless. Whether in love or friendship, society or politics, he cannot free himself from his own arrogance.

(16th March to 31st March 2019, Hong Kong Arts Centre Shouson Theatre)\n\nBlack Box Productions:\n\nThe Office\nWhile the staff in a company remains dutifully intent on self-protection, a shady transaction goes on behind the scenes. One day, the new janitor is embroiled in a tug-of-war between two members of staff, leading to a scuffle between junior and senior levels, reality and ideals, public and private.

(18th May to 2nd June 2018)\n\nThe Open Platform: Three Impaired Monkeys\nAn elderly father and his two sons share a small flat. The father's consciousness traverses past and present. He often re-enacts a family incident of which no one is aware, leading the sons to understand their father's devotion, and in turn, re-examining their own estranged relations. Families are a tapestry interwoven with thousands of strands of love and hate. The more people choose \"not to see, not to hear and not to speak,\" the veil of darkness becomes all the more apparent. Three Impaired Monkeys is written by Lai Yiu Ming and directed by Octavian Chan. (8th June to 18th June 2018)\n\nThe Open Platform: Castle of Glass\nSix amnesiacs are trapped in an unknown space. As if under a curse, they repeat their stories about the Fall of Hong Kong in 1941. An underground boss, a British officer, a Canadian soldier, a Japanese lieutenant, a young Chinese soldier and an old merchant step closer and closer to their destiny as they try to discover a hidden secret. Castle of Glass, a new drama written by Marcus Au and directed by Tony Wong, is a fable, perhaps also a prophecy.

Rather than using professionally trained, well-rehearsed actors, he has 19 normal urban dwellers each describing \"one fine day\" while the audience equipped with personal headphones can choose which story to listen to at any given time. Everyone holds a key to open the secret chambers in each of their hearts, finding empathy in the process. One Fine Day has already touched the hearts of audiences in Beijing, Shanghai and Hangzhou. Those who took part were inspired to ponder such issues as personal relationships and how people relate to society. An open call for participants will be organised for the Hong Kong premiere of One Fine Day. We aim to discover people and events that are quintessentially Hong Kong.

Tickets for its 2016 Taipei Arts Festival presentation sold out at record speed. (17th October to 21st October 2018)\n\nPost/ HKRep (Australia / Hong Kong) - Oedipus Schmoedipus\nTwo Australian artists-Zoë Coombs Marr and Mish Grigor-resurrect classic drama in Oedipus Schmoedipus, spinning lines, plots and symbolism drawn from masterworks dealing with the subject of death into a brand-new, fun-filled performance. What makes this production even more glorious is that apart from Coombs Marr and Grigor playing host, 25 members of the public are enlisted to take part in each show. With only a few hours' rehearsal on the day of performance, their appearance adds much excitement, making the Oedipus Schmoedipus experience totally unique. (26th October to 29th October 2018)\n\nMilo Rau / International Institute of Political Murder / CAMPO (Switzerland / Germany / Belgium) - Five Easy Pieces\nCelebrated Swiss director Milo Rau's Five Easy Pieces daringly involves seven children under 13, casting them through simple exercises in roles associated with a notorious 1990s case of a serial killer. The drama alludes to the mass demonstration of 30,000 against Belgium's corrupt judiciary. It also examines how children, through their actions, grapple with serious questions about morality. Voted as the top of the \"Top 10\" of the Berliner Festspiele-Theatertreffen 2017, Five Easy Pieces has toured Singapore and more than a dozen countries in Europe, catapulting this work to popular acclaim. It makes its Hong Kong and Beijing premieres in 2018.

A hefty tariff on Chinese steel is being floated while Chinese aluminium is rumoured to be on the chopping block. At Davos, the US Treasury secretary was talking down an already weak dollar. Are we seeing the start of a long-feared trade war between the US and East Asia, especially China?\nI suspect this is not a real trade war. The Trump administration doesn’t have a strategy to go all the way. The US economy depends on a vast stock market bubble and foreign financing of its fiscal deficit. Its tax cut is adding US$1.5 trillionto its deficit over the next decade, making it more dependent on foreign capital. If the US goes deep into a trade war or debasing the dollar, the stock market will crash, foreign money will flee, its bond yield will surge and its economy will crash.\nA credible trade war requires two elements: the US being prepared for a prolonged recession, and a coherent industrial policy. The US economy is driven by maximising short-term profitability for big listed companies. They have been driving the outsourcing model in global trade because cutting costs through outsourcing is the quickest way to boost profit. The high stock prices from the boosted earnings reward the top managers at these companies. The US CEOs have seen incredible increases in their incomes, far ahead of their counterparts in Germany and Japan, while its industrial workers face declining wages. Unless the US changes the incentive structure for its top corporate managers, this dynamic won’t change.\nGermany and Japan, while they don’t publicly admit it, have industrial policies. They concentrate resources in industries where they could achieve long-term competitiveness. Their CEOs put the country’s interest ahead of short-term profitability. And, they don’t pay themselves tens of millions of dollars, because their societies have implicit social contracts against it. They are still high-cost countries and can’t achieve high economic growth. But, a deep industrial base leads to a more stable and equitable economy.\nThe ongoing trade dispute with China continues the decades-long pattern in how the US handles its trade with the East. Four decades ago, the anti-Japan rhetoric was more heated than that against China today. Far more serious restrictions were imposed on Japanese steel, automobiles and electronic products. They have had no impact on how industrial development has evolved on both sides. What has changed is that industries have moved from one Asian country to another.\nEast Asia’s advantage in manufacturing is not just labour cost. Its labour quality is superior to that of the US. Even more important is cheap capital. East Asia has a high savings rate and accounts for most of the net savings in the world. Any capital-intensive industry is likely to be rooted there. An industry such as semiconductors may start in the US, but eventually becomes a typical East Asian industry, because it is capital intensive. This advantage in capital may be exaggerated by financial repression that boosts savings. Countries like China should eliminate financial repression. Still, even when government policy doesn’t tilt the savings rate one way or another, East Asia will have higher savings rates.\nAnglo-Saxon economies like the US, Britain and Australia practise the opposite of financial repression. Their financial markets tend to exaggerate paper wealth and encourage borrowing. Hence, they have an unusually low savings rate and high cost of capital. This is a key reason that Germany and Japan have stronger industries. If the US wants to reindustrialise, it must first stop excessive monetary stimulus that encourages debt.\nUS President Donald Trump’s protectionist policy will at best prolong the life of sunset industries like steel and aluminium. As the capital market sees their high cost, it will hold back and they will just wither away. For a new industry like solar panels, it will merely encourage tariff arbitrage. Some companies will start local assembly operations with imported components, mostly from China, similar to what developing countries used to do.\nA real trade war could occur only if the US’ asset bubble bursts and the Federal Reserve cannot start a new one. That would mean a prolonged recession. The nascent populist movement that got Trump elected could become a dominant force and completely change the country’s ruling elite. That is a possibility but not likely, at least in the next decade. The financial bubbles over the past three decades have created a powerful and extremely wealthy class. It is difficult to see that they will give up easily and see their wealth deflate under a new regime.\nThe US will stick to the whack-a-mole approach in its protectionist policy. It may scare the other parties into doing a few things to boost US exports, but the big picture won’t change. The US will continue to run large trade deficit until East Asian countries don’t want dollars any more. When that day comes, the dollar will collapse, and the US will slide into stagflation, while East Asian economies will be stuck with deflation.\nAndy Xie is an independent economist\nYou are signed up.

But this elevation would institutionalise its decision-making power and may change the command chain in the government,” said Xie Yanmei, a researcher with Gavekal Dragonomics.\n“It’s becoming much clearer that the party makes policies and the government departments implement their decisions,” she said.\nChina unveils bold overhaul to tighten Communist Party control\nThree other leading groups – on reform, cybersecurity and foreign affairs – have also become commissions as part of Xi’s ambition to have the party controlling all aspects of the country.\nThe change will make it easier for the party to implement its decisions, but observers said it would do little to reassure foreign businesses who want Beijing to deliver on its promises to open up the financial sector.\n\nWith Premier Li Keqiang as its deputy and Politburo members and State Council department heads making up the leading group, Xi has described it as “an important platform” for the party’s leadership on the economy.\nIt shares an office with economic planner the National Development and Reform Commission at present, but that could change under the new structure.\nDetails of how the new commissions will function have yet to be released.\nLiu was also appointed vice-premier during the National People’s Congress over the weekend.\nAt the World Economic Forum in Davos, Liu said Beijing would unveil opening-up measures this year that could exceed market expectations, and that China’s economic transformation would create huge opportunities for foreign companies.\nLiu He: China’s new one-man debt bomb disposal unit\nBut with no further details of these reforms released, frustration is building among foreign firms and governments that want to see changes in market access and business practices, with a trade war looming between China and the United States.\nChristopher Balding, an associate professor at the HSBC Business School in Shenzhen, said turning the leading group into a commission would not do much to change how foreigners perceive China’s progress on reforms.\nForeign companies had heard so many promises that China would open up and reform, he said, but they wanted concrete and immediate action.\nBut Xie with Gavekal Dragonomics said “the direction of reform is a political issue not an institutional matter”, and that Beijing would follow its own path on reform, not the liberalisation advocated by the West.\nYou are signed up.

The relative quiet in the currency markets may soon end\nComments:\n\nThe turmoil in global stock markets is intensifying by the day.\nLast Friday, US equities suffered one of their sharpest daily declines since an outbreak of volatility swept through markets earlier this year. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, a leading US equity index, dipped back into correction territory, having fallen more than 10 per cent since its peak on January 26.\nWhile the turbulence was initially triggered by fears about a faster-than-anticipated withdrawal of monetary stimulus, the severe escalation in trade tensions between Washington and Beijing has become the main source of anxiety, fuelled by growing concerns that President Donald Trump’s administration is now led by “China hawks”, presided over by Trump himself.\nWhat way out for Hong Kong in US-China trade war?\nYet despite the upheaval in stock markets, one of the world’s largest and most actively traded asset classes, the US$5 trillion-a-day foreign exchange market, has been remarkably unperturbed.\nThe VIX Index, Wall Street’s “fear gauge” which measures the anticipated volatility in the benchmark S&P 500 equity index, has surged since late January and currently stands close to its level during the panic sparked by the surprise devaluation of the renminbi in August 2015. Meanwhile, the JPMorgan Global FX Volatility Index, a benchmark for implied volatility across currency markets, has fallen since mid-February and has just experienced its third successive weekly decline.\nIn a note published on Friday, JPMorgan rightly observed that currency markets, which are influenced mainly by developments in monetary policy, “have been sidelined and [have been] something of a sideshow to developments in other markets in recent months”.\nThe clearest example of this has been the relative stability of the US dollar, with the dollar index, a gauge of the performance of the greenback against a basket of other major currencies, “confined to a range of less than 2 per cent for almost three months”, JPMorgan noted, in the face of the tariff-fuelled turmoil in equity markets.\nThe index has even risen since early February, by nearly 1.5 per cent, despite the persistent bearishness towards the dollar, evidenced by the results of last month’s global fund manager survey, by Bank of America Merrill Lynch, showing that the “short dollar” trade – bets against the greenback – remains the second most crowded trade behind wagers on a further rally in technology stocks.\nMoreover, the halt in the dollar’s decline – the index plunged by 14 per cent between the start of 2017 and the end of January this year – comes at a time when a confluence of factors point to a revival in the greenback’s fortunes.\n\nThe most obvious one is the fact that the dollar, which had become significantly overvalued by the end of 2015 following a 1½-year-long bull run stemming from expectations of a rise in US interest rates, has already undergone a significant correction (especially against the euro). It is now cheaper versus other major currencies.\nMore importantly, one of the key catalysts for a weaker greenback – the perceived convergence in global monetary policies as the world’s other main central banks prepare the ground for a withdrawal of stimulus – is losing momentum.\nWhy 2018 could be the year of the US dollar\nThe euro zone, which grew at a much faster-than-expected pace last year, is now expanding at its slowest rate since early 2017. IHS Markit, a data provider, says the bloc’s economy “came off the boil in March”. Moreover, core inflation (which strips out volatile food and energy prices) remains stuck at 1 per cent – half the target of the European Central Bank. In Japan, meanwhile, the central bank’s inflation target is even further out of reach.\nThe normalisation of monetary policy in Europe and Japan has become a more distant prospect than appeared to be the case only several months ago. This increases the scope for the dollar to benefit from a much more hawkish Federal Reserve, which anticipates further rate hikes later this year amid a pick-up in inflation.\nEra of cheap money simply has to end\nStrong US dollar likely to be early casualty in Trump’s trade wars\nThe dollar could also gain from the threat of a trade war between the US and China if, as Morgan Stanley believes, it results in an outcome that ends up lowering America’s hefty trade deficit.\nStill, dollar bears have reasons to be confident. While the greenback is cheaper, it is still overvalued. As I noted in an earlier column, the dollar has also failed to act as a reliable safe haven during periods of turmoil, partly because of the US’ rapidly deteriorating fiscal position. Trump’s nationalist and protectionist policies only add to the greenback’s woes.\nThe fact that the outlook for the dollar has become more uncertain adds to the growing number of risks in markets – particularly in developing economies, which have benefited significantly from the dollar’s decline.\nGlobal currency markets are unlikely to remain a sideshow for much longer.\nNicholas Spiro is a partner for Lauressa Advisory\nYou are signed up.

Phelps says China, like Western countries before, has realised that ‘zeal’ isn’t enough – society benefits most when competition is encouraged\nComments:\n\nFrom the early 19th century to the early 20th century, Western countries attributed their economic growth to the discoveries of “scientists and navigators”. A country needed only the “zeal” to develop “obvious” commercial applications, and build the facilities to meet demand for new products.\nUntil recently, the Chinese believed the same thing. But now, Chinese businesspeople and entrepreneurs are increasingly showing not only the entrepreneurial drive to adapt to new opportunities, but also the desire and capacity to innovate for themselves, rather than copying what’s already out there.\nIndeed, more and more Chinese companies are realising that they must innovate in order to get – and stay – ahead in the global economy. Several companies – notably Alibaba, Baidu and Tencent – made breakthroughs by offering digital-age infrastructure that facilitates innovative activity. And industrial firms have recently moved into robots and artificial intelligence.\nFor its part, China’s government is evidently supportive of Chinese businesses developing a capacity to produce indigenous innovations. It no doubt recognises that such innovations are all the more valuable when innovation remains weak in the West, where growth in total factor productivity has continued its long slowdown.\nIn recent years, China’s government has introduced initiatives aimed at increasing both entrepreneurship and innovation. It has dramatically shortened the process for forming a new company. It has built a vast number of schools, where Chinese children learn more about the world they will face. And it recently facilitated the entry of foreign experts to work on new projects in the business sector.\nThe authorities have also recognised the importance of allowing more competition in the economy. Individuals should be freed up to start new companies, and existing companies should be freed up to enter new industries. Competition solves a lot of problems – a point that is increasingly lost on the West.\nAt the World Economic Forum’s annual meeting in Davos, Switzerland, in January, Chinese officials discussed basic reforms that the government introduced two years ago to increase competition. Under the new policy, excess capacity now signals that supply should be allowed to contract and prompt redundant firms to exit the market. Of course, excess demand signals that supply should be allowed to increase, leading to the entry of new firms.\nThe key insight is that when existing enterprises are protected from new market entrants bearing new ideas, the result will be less innovation and less “adaptation” to a changing world, to use Friedrich Hayek’s term.\n\nAnother argument can be made. In any modern economy, virtually every industry operates in the face of a largely unknowable future. The more companies an industry has thinking about a problem, the more likely a solution is to be found. A company that has been kept out of an industry might know something that all the companies in the industry do not. Or some unique experience may have furnished an individual with “personal knowledge” that is impossible to transmit to others who have not had the same experience. Whatever the case, society benefits – through lower prices, more jobs, better products and services, and so forth – when outsiders with something to add are free to do so.\nAll of this was known to the great theorists of the 1920s and 1930s: Hayek, Frank Knight and John Maynard Keynes. And now it is known to the Chinese, who understand that a country benefits when companies – each with its own thinking and knowledge – are free to compete.\nThe West seems to have forgotten this. Since the 1930s, most Western governments have seen it as their duty to protect established enterprises from competition, even when it comes from new firms offering new adaptations or innovations. These protections, which come in myriad forms, have almost certainly discouraged many entrepreneurs from coming forward with new and better ideas.\n\nHistory is rife with evidence of the value of competition. In post-war Britain, into the 1970s, industries were controlled by exclusive clubs within the Confederation of British Industry, which barred new entrants. By the time Margaret Thatcher became prime minister in 1979, total factor productivity (TFP) had stagnated. But Thatcher put a stop to the confederation’s anti-competitive practices, and Britain’s TFP was growing again by the mid-1980s.\nWe are now seeing something similar in China. By 2016, China’s TFP growth rate had been slowing for a number of years. But since the reforms that year, it has been increasing.\nThe West must address its great TFP slowdown, which has lasted since the late 1960s. Ending protection of incumbents from new entrants possessing ideas for new adaptations and innovations is a good place to start.\nEdmund S.

One part looks at the effect of using the currency as a tool in trade negotiations with the US, while a second part examines what would happen if China depreciates the yuan to offset the impact of any trade deal that curbs exports.\nThe analysis doesn’t mean officials will carry out a devaluation, which would require approval from top leaders, the people said, asking not to be named as the information is private. The yuan weakened as much as 0.2 per cent to 6.3186 per dollar in onshore trading on Monday before trading little changed as of 5:49pm local time. China’s central bank didn’t immediately respond to a faxed request for comment.\n“It seems as if Beijing is showing the full extent of policies they could deploy in response to Trump’s protectionist rampage,” said Viraj Patel, a strategist at ING Bank NV in London.\nWhile Trump regularly bashed China on the campaign trail for keeping its currency artificially weak, the yuan has gained about 9 per cent against the greenback since he took office and has been steady in recent weeks despite the escalation of trade tensions between the world’s two largest economies. The Chinese currency touched the strongest level since August 2015 last month.\nOther markets have been far more turbulent as both the US and China proposed tariffs on US$50 billion of goods and Trump instructed his administration to consider levies on an additional US$100 billion of Chinese products.\nThe S&P 500 Index has slumped more than 9 per cent from this year’s peak in January, while the Shanghai Composite Index has lost 12 per cent on concern that tensions between America and China could devolve into a full-blown trade war. Yields on US Treasuries have also declined from this year’s highs as investors shifted into haven assets.\nWhile a weaker yuan could help President Xi Jinping shore up China’s export industries in the event of widespread tariffs in the US, a devaluation comes with plenty of risks. It would encourage Trump to follow through on his threat to brand China a currency manipulator, make it more difficult for Chinese companies to service their mountain of offshore debt, and undermine recent efforts by the government to move toward a more market-oriented exchange rate system.\nOpinion: Slumping US dollar no longer a one-way bet as volatility returns to currency markets\nIt would also expose China to the risk of local financial-market volatility, something authorities have worked hard to subdue in recent years. When China unexpectedly devalued the yuan by about 2 per cent in August 2015, the move sent shock-waves through global markets.\n“Is it in their interest to devalue yuan? It’s probably unwise,” said Kevin Lai, chief economist for Asia ex-Japan at Daiwa Capital Markets Hong Kong. “Because if they use devaluation as a weapon, it could hurt China more than the US The currency stability has helped to create a macro stability. If that’s gone, it could destabilise markets, and things would look like 2015 again.”\nGiven the downsides, China is unlikely to resort to a devaluation unless it exhausts its other trade-negotiation tools, said Frances Cheung, head of Asia macro strategy at Westpac Banking in Singapore. The more likely scenario is that the two countries will reach a compromise and China will continue to liberalise its capital account, added Zhou Hao, senior Asia emerging markets economist at Commerzbank AG.\n“There are many measures they can take before resorting to this tool,” said Ken Peng, an investment strategist at Citi Private Bank in Hong Kong. “Using yuan depreciation is like sacrificing 800 soldiers of your own to kill just 1,000 enemies.”\nStill, that doesn’t mean market-driven yuan weakness is off the table. The average forecast among analysts tracked by Bloomberg calls for the currency to drop slightly by year-end to 6.38 per dollar. China limits daily fluctuations in the yuan to 2 per cent on either side of a reference rate set by the central bank.\n“There is room for a near-term yuan correction given how much the currency has gained since last year,” said Ken Cheung, a currency strategist at Mizuho Bank in Hong Kong. “China would allow market-driven yuan weakness if sentiment fluctuates on trade war concerns. But it’s unlikely for the authorities to engineer another round of significant one-off devaluation.”\nTraders looking for clues on President Xi’s thinking will soon get the opportunity to hear him speak. On Tuesday he’s scheduled to address the Boao Forum for Asia -- China’s answer to Davos -- on the tropical island of Hainan.\nYou are signed up. We think you'd also like\n"}

HNA’s businesses also belong to the party, the people and mankind,” Chen said.\nThe conference was held at a time when HNA is eager for government support as it scrambles for funds to repay debts. The company that started as a small regional airline 25 years ago is under mounting pressure after a US$40 billion overseas investment spree ranging from an aircraft leasing firm in Ireland to 25 per cent of Hilton Worldwide and land in Hong Kong.\n\nBut Chen told the party members that HNA had been operating “in high conformity” with the “idea of the shared destiny of mankind promoted by [Xi]”, according to the statement. He added that HNA was trying to create its own chapter of the “Chinese dream”, another phrase popularised by Xi.\nThere was no mention of the conglomerate’s financial difficulties, according to the statement, but the conference heard that its success would come down to whether “its interests are kept in line with the national interest, the public interest and its employees’ interests”.\nHNA ditches vanity purchases for Silk Road commodity deals to vie for Beijing’s support\nIt is common practice in China for private businesses to set up party committees. According to official data, nearly 70 per cent of non-public businesses had party committees or groups in 2016. Many private enterprises have started playing up the role of the party in their businesses and their loyalty to Xi since the 19th party congress in October.\nThe statement also said HNA was owned by “social charity organisations”, making it “a charity business with a mission to serve the country and the people”.\nIt considered itself “a drop of water in the ocean of the nation, the society and the country”, it said.\nThe meeting began with members singing March of the Volunteers, China’s national anthem, and ended with left-wing anthem The Internationale, the statement said.\nIt was held after HNA co-chairman Wang Jian told board members last week that the group was the victim of a conspiracy against the Chinese government and that it was one of the country’s most loyal companies, according to a Bloomberg report.\nWang said recent attacks came from “reactionary forces from both China and overseas countering China’s rise, and are a major conspiracy against the Communist Party Central Committee with Xi Jinping at its core” to disrupt China’s financial markets and subvert party rule.\nChinese banks freeze HNA’s accounts after finding multiple loans tied to the same collateral\nHNA’s global shopping spree partly benefited from an accommodative monetary policy, but since last year, tighter rules on lending and deleveraging efforts in the financial system spearheaded by Xi have made it difficult for the company to cover its loans with sufficient cash.\nChen told Reuters in January that HNA faced liquidity problems, which prompted a slump in its subsidiaries’ shares, and the company has been selling assets to tackle its cash crunch. In late January, one of its subsidiaries sold a Sydney office block for A$205 million (US$160 million) that it bought for A$117 million in 2012.\nIn November, the group issued a 363-day US dollar bond with a high coupon rate of 8.875 per cent, an indicator of its cash shortage. At the end of that month, rating company Standard & Poor’s – concerned about HNA’s massive maturing debt and rising borrowing costs – downgraded HNA’s rating by one notch to B.\nIn the first 11 months of last year, HNA Group had about 637.5 billion yuan (US$100.9 billion) in unpaid loans, according to its filing. By comparison, Hainan province, where the group is registered, had a gross domestic product of more than 440 billion yuan (US$69.6 billion) last year.\nHNA’s chief executive to skip 2018 Davos meeting amid staff memo urging for austerity\nIt was not HNA’s first meeting of party members – the company set up a Communist Party committee in 2015 and has since responded to calls from Xi for “party building” and group study of the party congress document from October, according to the company’s website.\nYou are signed up.

Her visit concludes with a stop in Shanghai.\nMay’s trip comes as Britain’s prospective withdrawal from the European Union after the stunning “Brexit” referendum is seen as giving London more flexibility to set trade deals with China. On that note, May is travelling to China with a delegation of business leaders representing a broad range of sectors.\nHere are five things to watch for during May’s trip:\nCan May shift the “golden era” between China and Britain into a higher gear via economic cooperation?\nIn a statement ahead of her trip, May said her visit would “intensify the ‘golden era’ in UK-China relations.\n“The depth of our relationship means we can have frank discussions on all issues,” the prime minister said.\n“There are huge trade opportunities in China that we want to help British businesses take advantage of.”\n\nPresident Xi Jinping used the term “golden era” to describe relations between China and Britain during his state visit in 2015. A highlight of that trip was the two sides signing deals worth £400 billion (US$565.45 billion).\nA delegation of more than 40 business leaders is accompanying May. Members represent such blue-chip public companies as BP, HSBC, Inmarsat, Standard Chartered, Sirius Minerals, Standard Life Aberdeen, AstraZeneca and the London Stock Exchange Group.\nEven fewer signings this time around would be a step forward for two countries whose economic ties were bruised by Britain’s decision to quit the European Union. China’s goal had been to make London a gateway to the broader EU, according to Wang Yiwei, a Beijing-based European issues specialist.\nBritish Prime Minister Theresa May has ambitious partnership plans for China, diplomat says\nBritish trade with China has surged 60 per cent since 2010, and last year, with the world adjusting to the Brexit vote after its initial shock, Britain’s China-bound exports jumped 30 per cent.\nFor its part, China remains interested in investing in British assets, particularly in high-profile infrastructure projects such as the Hinkley Point nuclear power plant on the Bristol Channel coast of Somerset, England.\nChina, through state-owned China General Nuclear Power Corporation, owns a third of the project, which May’s government has said reflects Britain’s openness to foreign investment.\nChina also is eyeing a potential British high-speed rail contract as part of its global push.\n“Unlike the EU and the US, the UK has not signalled any meaningful toughening of foreign investment screening and the door is very much open to foreign investors,” said Tim Gee, a partner with London law firm Baker McKenzie.\n\nWill May endorse Beijing’s massive belt and road infrastructure programme?\nA priority for Beijing during May’s visit likely is getting Britain’s formal endorsement of Xi’s signature programme, the “Belt and Road Initiative”, which aims to increase China’s trade and infrastructure links to Asia and beyond.\n“If Prime Minister May is smart enough she would know what China wants to hear from her the most is the support of the belt and road,” said Jin Canrong, a Renmin University international relations scholar.\nMay last year sent Britain’s Chancellor of the Exchequer Philip Hammond to attend Xi’s Belt and Road Forum a few weeks before Britons went to the polls in a general election. Later that year Hammond said Britain would appoint a special envoy to handle belt and road-related issues and form a Belt and Road Council of senior British business leaders who were interested in the plan’s infrastructure initiatives.\nMay’s office has refused to confirm whether the prime minister would formally endorse belt and road, reflecting the pressure she faces from the administration of US President Donald Trump who has labelled China a strategic competitor, the Financial Times has reported.\nHow Brexit Britain can gain from China’s Belt and Road\nBritain’s ambassador to Beijing, Barbara Woodward, told reporters on Monday that in line with the vision of a “global Britain” May articulated at the World Economic Forum at Davos last week, Britain saw itself as a “natural partner” in the “Belt and Road Initiative”.\nBritain’s companies and financial institutions have shown they are keen to bring “international standards” to the China-backed projects, Woodward said.\nBritain was the first major Western country to join the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, an important finance organ formed to support belt and road projects, the ambassador said.\n\nWill May raise Hong Kong’s concerns with Beijing?\nIt is not clear if May’s promise of “frank discussions on all issues” includes emphasising to the Chinese leadership that Britain’s former colony of Hong Kong faces growing threats to “basic freedoms, human rights and autonomy”, as Chris Patten, Hong Kong’s last British governor, told May in a letter.\nPatten and Ashdown call on UK PM Theresa May to speak up for Hong Kong during China trip\nPatten wrote that he wanted May to speak up on behalf of Hong Kong on topics including the enforcing of mainland law at a cross-border railway’s Hong Kong terminal; local authorities’ denial of Hong Kong entry for British human rights activist Benedict Rogers and Chief Executive Carrie Lam’s comment that a damning report by Patten’s fellow British peer Paddy Ashdown, a co-founder of the London-based Hong Kong Watch group, raising concerns about the city’s rule of law amounted to “meddling” in China’s and Hong Kong’s affairs.\nWang Yiwei, the European issues specialist, said it would not surprise the Chinese side to hear May raise Hong Kong’s issues but the talk would be unlikely to go anywhere.\n“Hong Kong has always been a topic of the conservatives and there can hardly be any compromise on this as one of their basic values,” Wang said.\n\nWhat is May doing in Wuhan and Shanghai?\nOn the one hand, Wuhan’s inclusion on May’s itinerary seems surprising. The city rarely has been a destination of visiting foreign leaders. One exception was former French President Jacques Chirac’s 2006 visit to a Franco-China joint car factory.\nBut the capital of Hubei province is home to 85 colleges and more than 1 million students. That makes it an important educational hub in China and attractive to the British education sector, which is represented in May’s delegation.\nStudents fearing they may lose place at UK universities flood helpline set up by Hong Kong leader\nHer entourage includes a representative from the University of Manchester, based in Wuhan’s sister city of Manchester, England.\nThere are 160,000 Chinese students in Britain.\n\nHow high on May’s agenda is North Korea?\nAs fellow permanent members of the UN Security Council that has imposed punishing sanctions on North Korea over its nuclear provocations, Britain and China have a growing number of common interests, according to Woodward.\nThey also have numerous potential collaboration opportunities. In that regard, North Korea’s nuclear programme and UN sanctions, the Winter Olympic Games in Pyeongchang County, South Korea and climate change are on the agenda for May’s China visit.\nUN Security Council unanimously approves tough new sanctions on North Korea\nChina and Britain both could benefit from collaborating to halt terroristic activity by Islamic State fighters and other hostile groups in hotspots such as Afghanistan and Pakistan. They also could profit from working together to counter human-trafficking and jointly strengthening aviation security against terrorism.\nThe two nations also could reap benefits from teaming up to combat the illegal manufacture and distribution of the pain medication fentanyl from China.\nTrump has claimed that fentanyl from China, which recreational drug users often mix with heroin or cocaine, has “flooded” the West.\nYou are signed up.

{"title": "The surprising rise of China as IP powerhouse", "author": "TechCrunch", "pub_time": "2017年4月11日", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2017/04/11/the-surprising-rise-of-china-as-ip-powerhouse/", "content": "The contrast could not be more stark: Xi Jinping, the first president of China to attend the World Economic Forum in Davos in January, leading the largest Chinese contingent ever and pledging enduring support for free trade and open markets, versus newly inaugurated President Donald Trump promising to “make America First” and threatening renewed trade barriers, especially with China, and dumping the TPP.\nMr. Xi was treated like a rock star by the Davos capitalists, and while never mentioning Trump (or, for that matter, Britain’s protectionist Brexit withdrawal) by name, he unmistakably took aim against them. Taking on a mantle of global leadership, Mr. Xi said “[n]o one will emerge as a winner in a trade war,” and compared protectionism to “locking oneself in a dark room.” It’s not clear anything in the meeting between President Xi and President Trump last week adjusted these positions.\nThese radical paradigm shifts should be of utmost importance to Silicon Valley, particularly companies whose models and profits are based on proprietary intellectual property.\nChina is not only taking the spotlight in strong defense of global markets and free trade, filling a vacuum left by retreating Western capitalist democracies, China is quickly becoming a (if not the) global leader in intellectual property protection and enforcement. And there too, just as Western democracies (especially the United States) have grown increasingly skeptical of the value of intellectual property and have weakened protection and enforcement, China has been steadily advancing its own intellectual property system and the protected assets of its companies and citizens.\nA few surprising facts:\nStereotypes die hard. China has long been seen as the land of copycats, with open market bins of bootleg DVDs, counterfeit fashion and blatant technology infringement. But Silicon Valley and the new administration ignore the changing landscape in China to their peril.\nWhile China continues to have significant problems of IP theft (industrial espionage, counterfeited goods and services, trademark squatting, etc.), its leadership and government agencies have made concerted efforts to propel their intellectual property systems into the 21st century.\nIn 2014, China began opening specialized intellectual property courts in Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou. For some time, China’s People’s High Court (itself with a surprising 340 judges) has had divisions especially focused on IP issues. And although China’s patent laws are only about 30 years old, last year China published its Fourth Amendment to its IP laws, increasing statutory damages five-fold (to 5 million RMB, or US $727,000) and expanding a number of patent and enforcement provisions.\nIndeed, given legislative amendments and administrative and judicial decisions, some commentators have noted that it is easier to protect cutting-edge software, business-method and biotechnical inventions in China than the United States.\nBottom line: China is becoming an IP powerhouse in every sense of the word.\nThose of us who’ve met with China’s intellectual property policymakers, judges, administrators and enforcers over the last few years have been struck with the coordinated seriousness of their actions and efforts. International pressure, but more importantly domestic demand from Chinese companies, has driven this furious pace of change.\nLeading Chinese companies, like Alibaba, Xiaomi, Huawei and HTC have sophisticated IP business departments focused on protecting their own advanced research and development. China’s journey from piracy to protection models the journeys of other Western and Asian countries. While building its industrial economies, the U.S. and major European powers violated IP laws with no consideration. As reported by the Guardian, Doron Ben-Atar, a history professor at Fordham University, has noted that “US and every major European state engaged in technology piracy and industrial espionage in the 18th and 19th century.” It took Western economies a hundred or more years to change that behavior. China’s mind-whipping change is happening over decades, not centuries.\nSo what are U.S. and other non-Chinese firms to make of all this? Any company focused on global expansion must factor China, vying with India for the largest domestic market, into its strategies. (And that’s all Valley companies. It’s said that every company is a global concern; they just don’t know it yet.) China will be a key market for products or services and a source of manufacturing and design. More importantly, it may nurture your competitors. This makes a focus on IP critical as never before.\nProtecting your valuable brands and innovations, through trademarks and patent applications in China, can’t wait on the back burner. Protection strategies can no longer be “check-the-box” or “nice-to-have” approaches. Companies must focus IP protection in China strategically, making it a centerpiece of a global approach, not an afterthought.\nYes, this takes focus, time and resources. But long-term thinking must become short-term thinking. Intellectual assets are long-term assets: patents last 20 years from filing; trademarks and copyrights far longer.\nChina today is light years from the China of the 1990s. Given China’s determination to advance its IP systems and stature, China may well eclipse U.S. and Europe as the global center for intellectual property in just a few decades. Companies with long-term vision must place bets accordingly.\n"}

US telecoms company AT&T walked away from a deal with Huawei, a Chinese telecom equipment and smart device maker, under pressure from US Congress. The US government also rejected the intended acquisition of MoneyGram, a US money transfer company, by Ant Financial, an affiliate of China’s internet giant, Alibaba.\nIt was reported that both deals triggered US “national security” concerns. The media are now saying that, on Capitol Hill, there is a prevailing wind of “trust deficit” in US-China relations on trade and investments.\nThere seems to be two parts to this story. The first concerns Chinese companies investing in the US. The theory goes like this. The Chinese government is behind everything that Chinese businesses are doing and state-owned enterprises, because of their government ownership, will act on behalf of the Chinese government’s interests. By implication, their motives are not trustworthy. In addition, the Chinese government employs strong industrial policies that create an unfair playing field for companies and countries.\nThe second part of the story is about the perception of how US companies are treated in China. The key thesis here is that the Chinese market is closed to US (and for that matter all foreign) companies. The Chinese government favours local enterprises, especially state-owned companies, and so US companies cannot be successful in China. Many US politicians and lobbyists are asking for “reciprocity”.\nThere are some elements of truth in both of these arguments. However, they do not present the complete picture.\nWhile the state sector is certainly prevalent in China, the non-state sector is actually becoming more powerful in its own right. According to Chinese government statistics, the non-state industrial sector’s revenue in 2016 was close to four times that of the state sector. About the same ratio also applies to the total profit.\nBased on a study by the Institute of Population and Labour Economics at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, China’s “new economy” – internet-based businesses including e-commerce and car-hailing services – grew twice as quickly as China’s overall gross domestic product in the 10 years to 2016. By definition, these new-economy companies are mostly, if not entirely, private-sector companies. Entrepreneurship and business innovation are thriving in China and they come mostly from the private sector.\nUS President Donald Trump has called for the “re-shoring” of manufacturing to the US. Ironically, some Chinese companies were among the first to respond to the call. Companies such as Fuyao Glass, Foxconn and Great Wall Motors – all non-state owned – announced plans to invest in the US. (Foxconn is, of course a Taiwanese company but its operations are mainly on the Chinese mainland). And Jack Ma, Alibaba’s chairman, pledged to create “one million jobs” in the US. [Alibaba is the owner of the South China Morning Post.]\nSince its economic reform that started some four decades ago, China has gradually opened its sectors to foreign participation. Today, while there are still some that are closed or largely closed to foreign companies, a much larger number are open to competition, for example in consumer products and retail.\nFor US companies such as Nike, Starbucks, Apple, Ford and General Motors, China is one of their largest markets, if not the largest, in the world. And, China’s importance to these companies continues to rise. The “golden era” of foreign companies, at least for these successful ones in China, is certainly not over.\n\nMany pundits have suggested that China’s “Great Firewall” has blocked all US tech companies from doing business in China. The likes of Facebook and Twitter are indeed blocked in China, and others like Google chose to withdraw as a stand against China’s censorship requirements. (It’s worth noting, however, that Google recently announced the establishment of a major artificial intelligence centre in Beijing.) However, there are many other tech companies that are not blocked. LinkedIn, Airbnb and Amazon’s e-commerce are all operating in China. Uber and eBay were allowed but they decided to divest largely due to extremely strong local competition (from the non-state sector).\nAt the 19th national congress of China’s Communist Party last October, President Xi Jinping made the pledge that China will continue to open up its economy to foreign companies. In November, the government announced plans to ease limits on foreign ownership in a range of financial services. Further liberalisation is expected over time.\nSimilar to how US companies are investing in China to try to capture the Chinese market, more Chinese companies are also investing in the US. Triangle, the third-largest Chinese tyre manufacturer, is investing in a US$580 million plant in North Carolina. To many Chinese companies, the US is an attractive market and the conditions for manufacturing are becoming more favourable.\nAs Chinese innovation and entrepreneurship continue to thrive, there will certainly be more opportunities for start-ups involving both Chinese and US entrepreneurs, and venture capitalists. Technology, especially AI, will increasingly be embraced for innovation.\nBoth the US and China are now leading the world in the development and application of AI, and this trend is likely to continue to accelerate. The interactions between China and the US at the start-up and investors’ levels are actually taking place intensively as there is so much to share and many opportunities to jointly pursue. Much of this is reflected in cross-border investment.\nIt would be naive to expect smooth sailing for the US-China trade and investment relationship this year. However, I don’t believe all will be bad, either. There will be areas of tension and differences in points of view and policies, but there will also be areas of collaboration and alignment.\n“Coopetition” is perhaps the best word to describe the nature of this relationship. It won’t be a zero-sum game, especially not in today’s world of increasing connectivity.\nEdward Tse is founder and CEO of Gao Feng Advisory Company, a global strategy and management consulting firm with roots in Greater China.

Strong gains were seen in Hainan-related shares in the mainland market amid rising hopes that China would announce market access reforms on Tuesday at the Boao Forum.\nThe Hang Seng Index climbed 1.29 per cent, or 384.64 points, to close at 30,229.58, its biggest daily gain since March 12. The Hang Seng China Enterprises Index increased by 0.88 per cent to 12,073. Turnover of the mainboard was HK$115.22 billion (US$14.68 billion), the first increase in five sessions.\nPresident Xi Jinping is due to deliver a speech at the Boao Forum held on Hainan Island in south China, an annual summit that’s been dubbed the “ Asian Davos”, which could provide clues on Xi’s stance in settling China-US trade disputes, analysts said.\nInvestors are watching for any remarks regarding measures to open up markets further, with President Xi expected to announce plans for two new free-trade ports on the island, which would grant greater autonomy, economic freedom and market access for foreigners.\nOn Sunday, President Trump tweeted that China will take down its trade barriers because it is “the right thing to do”. His top economic adviser Larry Kudlow added that he saw jitters in the trade negotiations but did not expect a trade war.\n“I don’t think the Chinese government will want to see the markets slide ahead of the Boao Forum, since President Xi will be giving a keynote speech there,” said Louis Tse Ming-kwong, director at VC Brokerage Limited. “The market is very much oversold.”\nAdditionally, the stabilisation of Hong Kong’s Hibor rates – a gauge of banks’ short-term funding costs – and the recent decline in mainland Chinese bond yields were benefiting their respective stock markets, the Industrial & Commercial Bank of China said in a research note.\nShares in Sunny Optical Technology, China’s biggest smartphone camera manufacturer and one of Asia’s best-performing stocks this year, jumped 5.87 per cent to a five-day high of HK$151.40. Its shares have already surged 52 per cent since the start of 2018.\nInternet giant Tencent Holdings increased 1.03 per cent to HK$410.\nGeely Auto surged 5.16 per cent to HK$23.45 after Citigroup reported that the new LK02 sedan was expected to be launched this month that would be a new catalyst for the mainland car manufacturer.\n\nFinancials also fared well. Ping An Insurance (Group) advanced 1.13 per cent to HK$80.40, China Construction Bank was up 0.76 per cent to HK$7.99 and HSBC Holdings was up 1.57 per cent to HK$74.20, contributing as much as 46 points to the city’s benchmark index. Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing gained 1.92 per cent to HK$255.40.\nChina Mobile climbed 2.73 per cent to HK$73.50.\nHowever United Company Rusal, one of the world’s biggest aluminium producers, plunged 50.43 per cent to a two-year low of HK$2.30 after the US government slapped sanctions on the company’s co-owner and Russian magnate Oleg Deripaska and firms linked to him.\nMainland stocks were narrowly mixed, with the Shanghai Composite Index edging up 0.23 per cent to 3,138.29 while the CSI 300, which tracks top-performing stocks in Shanghai and Shenzhen, slid 0.05 per cent to 3,852.93.\nThe Shenzhen Composite Index inched up 0.01 per cent to 1,831.83 while the Nasdaq-style ChiNext Composite Index rose 0.26 per cent to 1,841.65.\nHainan-based stocks gained as the ahead of the Boao Forum. Hainan Dadonghai Tourism Centre Holdings’ shares soared by its 10 per cent daily limit to 13.73 yuan, Hainan Shennong Gene surged 5.29 per cent to 4.58 yuan and Hainan Expressway was up 3.92 per cent to 7.95 yuan.\nYou are signed up.

Our objective is to shrink that imbalance. … Our desire is to increase exports to shrink that,” the treasury secretary said.\n“On a high level, [the Chinese] understand that and they want to do that. Our objective is not to get into a trade war.”\nChina’s foreign ministry confirmed this week that Liu will be in the US until March 3 to discuss trade tension between the two countries.\nViews will be exchanged “on China-US relations and the two countries’ economic and trade cooperation”, ministry spokesman Lu Kang told reporters in Beijing.\nHowever, details of Liu’s meetings may not be divulged through official channels.\nA spokeswoman for China’s embassy in Washington told the South China Morning Post that they “are not reporting on this visit”.\nAt the US Chamber of Commerce event, Mnuchin reacted to a question about Liu’s visit, calling the trip “alleged”.\nMeanwhile, Trump’s administration has been announcing punitive actions against China, focusing first on very specific product categories.\nAs Mnuchin spoke, a trade group representing aluminium product producers announced that the US commerce department implemented punitive tariffs of as much as 106 per cent on imports of aluminium foil from some mainland Chinese companies.\n\nThe commerce department said in August – four months into its anti-dumping investigation on Chinese aluminium – that aluminium foil imports from the country amounted to US$388.8 million in 2016.\nLast month, Trump implemented a 30 per cent tariff on fully assembled imported solar panels and the cells used to make these panels, a move the US leader said was needed to protect American jobs.\nTrump will impose a 20 per cent tariff on the first 1.2 million imported large residential washers in the first year, and a 50 per cent tariff on machines above that number.\nIn August, US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer launched the Section 301 investigation, authorised under the US Trade Act of 1974, into Chinese regulations that force US companies operating in China to transfer technology and intellectual property rights to local business partners.\n\nSoon afterward, Lighthizer’s office began taking testimony from US companies, seeking verification that the Chinese government uses unfair tactics on US companies’ operations in China “to require or pressure the transfer of technologies and intellectual property to Chinese companies”, according to USTR documents.\nSpeaking at the US Chamber of Commerce, Mnuchin also said efforts are in play to reduce trade tension with other partners in Asia.\nTrump administration officials are discussing the possibility of resuming efforts to join the multilateral Pacific Rim trade pact known as the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which Trump withdrew from as one of his first acts in the White House.\n\n“I’ve met with several of my counterparties and other people, and we’ve begun to have very high-level conversations about TPP,” Mnuchin said. “It’s not a priority at the moment, but it is something that the president would consider.”\nTrump signed an executive order withdrawing the US from the Trans-Pacific Partnership last year, following through on a campaign pledge he said would help stem job losses.\nOfficials from the remaining TPP members – Japan, Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Peru, Singapore and Vietnam – have continued negotiations aimed at signing on to the pact in March.\nYou are signed up.

Under the Trade Act of 1974, the president may impose tariffs on imports deemed to hurt US industries. More actions loom on trade secrets, steel and aluminium, raising the prospects for a more confrontational relationship between the world’s key economic rivals and top political adversaries – the leading free democracy and last major communist-ruled power – which could herald the dawn of a dangerous new era for relations.\nThis development may signify the failure of joint efforts by Trump and Xi to navigate the most important bilateral relations in global diplomacy today and could well prolong their temporary suspension of the main official US-China dialogue to bolster economic ties.\nThe move followed publication of two China-related policy statements by the Trump administration. The national security strategy report identifies China as a “strategic competitor”, which seeks to erode US security and prosperity, and the 2017 Report to Congress on China’s WTO Compliance suggests widespread intellectual property theft and cyber espionage, forcing technology transfers and discriminatory practices limiting US companies’ access to the Chinese market.\n\nIn real terms, the damage of the punitive tariff to the economies of the world’s two largest trading powers will be small. But the consequences of this decision could be hard to determine, as they depend on how China might retaliate and whether any tit-for-tat confrontation eventually results in a damaging trade war. China has its own leverage and is likely to use the ammunition in its policy arsenal.\nBeijing might file a lawsuit against the US through the World Trade Organisation, as the White House’s decision was based on US law, not WTO rules. China could set up barriers to block the import of American products, delaying already agreed trade deals or imposing tariffs on some US exports to China. Beijing could also launch a patriotic campaign to boycott US products, as it has done with Japan and South Korea in recent years. And Beijing could threaten to sell US Treasuries, of which China is the single largest holder, potentially rattling the US financial system.\nBut the stakes are too high should the clash escalate into a full-blown trade war, given that the two economies together account for nearly a quarter of world merchandise trade and a fifth of global services trade, as well as over a third of global output.\nAs any trade war is mutually destructive by nature, any disruption will do damage to both sides. And it is not only a matter of whether they lose out, but whether the wider Asia-Pacific region, and the rest of the world, suffer as well because of the way globally integrated supply chains work.\nThe real danger is that Trump seems to be ignoring the risk. To show his determination, Trump, in his address to the World Economic Forum last week, clearly pointed the finger at Beijing and declared that “the United States will no longer turn a blind eye to unfair economic practices”. And speaking to Reuters last week, Trump said he didn’t want a trade war, “but if it there is, there is”.\nCary Huang is a senior writer at the Post\nYou are signed up. We think you'd also like\n"}

His administration has targeted China in major policy announcements on US national security strategy, defence strategy and China’s record of compliance with World Trade Organisation rules.\nThere’s reason to expect Trump’s first official state-of-the-union speech on Tuesday could bring more of the same.\nScott Kennedy, a China specialist at the Centre of Strategic and International Studies in Washington, said Trump clearly plans to adopt unilateral measures that will substantially affect Sino-US trade and investment ties.\n“Trump is not bluffing,” Kennedy said. “The question is no longer ‘if’, but ‘when’”.\nA spokesman for the president’s National Security Council seemed to back up that view.\nThe spokesman, who talked to the South China Morning Post on condition of anonymity, said that on Sino-US trade, “you can expect that the president will insist on fair and reciprocal trade” in his state-of-the-union speech.\n“The president has reiterated that the United States will use all available trade remedies to create a level playing field for United States workers and businesses,” the spokesman told the Post early last week, dismissing the idea of imminent announcement on new trade actions against China.\n“We have nothing to announce at this time,” he said.\nA week ago, Trump told Reuters that he would discuss the US’s trade imbalance with China and announce action on trade during the state-of-the-union address, an annual presentation by the US president to Congress primarily on his domestic policy priorities.\nTrump’s state of the union to tout ‘great success’ and make a plea to Democrats\nIn the interview with Reuters, Trump said the US could soon impose a potential big “fine” over China’s alleged intellectual property theft.\n“We have a very big intellectual property potential fine going, which is going to come out soon,” Trump was quoted as saying, without specifying what he meant by a “fine”.\nThe Trump administration currently has several investigations in progress targeting China on trade issues.\nOne, under Section 301 of the US Trade Act of 1974, targets alleged Chinese theft of intellectual property. A “Section 232” investigation focuses on security in connection with steel and aluminium imports. A third, government-initiated examination is looking into allegations that China has dumped alloy aluminium sheets, aided by what the administration calls an unfair use of subsidies.\n\nState-of-the-union addresses seldom get specific on foreign policy issues, according to Douglas Paal, vice-president for studies at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. “They are about domestic issues for a domestic audience primarily.”\nWhite House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders seemed to offer few clues about the substance of Trump’s address when she said on Monday its theme would be “building a safe, strong and proud America”.\nBut an anonymous senior US official in a briefing with reporters on Friday acknowledged Trump would talk about trade – as well as jobs, infrastructure, immigration and national security.\nCrunch time nears as Trump mulls trade sanctions against China\nIn an initial national security strategy statement in December, Trump said the US is engaged in “a new era of competition” with “competitors such as China”.\nThe president accused China of attempting to “erode” US security interests, “steal” US intellectual property and make economies “less free and fair”.\nTrump was quoted in the document as saying: “Our adversaries will not fight us on our terms,” although the “adversaries” were not identified.\n“We will raise our competitive game to meet that challenge, to protect American interests, and to advance our values,” the nation’s chief executive said.\n\nChina’s embassy in Washington reacted to Trump’s accusation scornfully, saying in a statement that the US’s “preaching rivalry and confrontation goes against the global trend, and will lead to failure”.\n“It is completely selfish for a country to claim that its own interests are superior to the interests of other countries and to the shared interests of the international community,” the statement said. “This mentality will only lead to isolation.”\nUS Defence Secretary James Mattis, using Trump’s national security statements as a springboard, labelled China as a “strategic competitor” and “central challenge” to the US in a speech on America’s defence strategy in Washington.\nChina should ‘be ready for a trade war’ after Donald Trump’s Davos speech\nMattis warned that China was “leveraging military modernisation, influence operations, and predatory economics to coerce neighbouring countries to reorder the Indo-Pacific region to their advantage”.\nChina subsequently called Mattis’ rhetoric an example of a “cold war” mentality designed to play up the “Chinese military threat”, the state-run Xinhua news agency reported.\n\nChinese National Defence Ministry spokesman Ren Guoqiang was quoted in the report that the US was full of unreal assertions of “zero-sum” games and confrontations.\nOn the same day, the US Trade Representative’s Office said in its annual report to Congress that the US made a mistake when it supported China’s membership of the WTO in 2001 because the agreed-upon terms have failed to force Beijing to open its economy.\nWhat are the trade cards Donald Trump could play against China?\n“It seems clear that the United States erred in supporting China’s entry into the WTO on terms that have proven to be ineffective in securing China’s embrace of an open, market-oriented trade regime,” the report said. “It is now clear that the WTO rules are not sufficient to constrain China’s market-distorting behaviour.”\nChina fought back on Monday, saying that the US, not China, threatens the global trade system.\nForeign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying told a regular news briefing in Beijing: “I think everyone has seen that it’s precisely the United States’ unilateralist methods, and the sounds it’s made on unilateralism, that are an unprecedented challenge to the multilateral trade system.”\nYou are signed up.

The challenge was figuring out how to turn Switzerland into a fortress that could keep out the flood of refugees a conflict would send its way.\nThe annual summit at Davos provides a real-world chance to explore such preparations.\n\"Rising nationalism in Europe is a trend that needs to be monitored,\" Major General Jean-Marc Halter, 54, Switzerland's second-highest ranking officer who took charge of the war game and is overseeing security at Davos, said in the Swiss capital, Bern. \"It's the army's job to protect the country against all possible security threats.\"\nWhile Switzerland hasn't seen conflict since the Sonderbund civil war of 1847, Davos has provided a chance to demonstrate military readiness ever since late Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat attended the forum in 1985. About 3,300 troops will protect government heads this year and secure the airspace in a 46 kilometre radius around the village.\nThe five-day event, which started yesterday, is the single biggest operation executed by the Swiss army this year.\n\"In Davos we gain insight into the effectiveness of our training, procedures and chain of command,\" said Halter, adding that instability on Europe's periphery is \"a scenario that needs to be thought through\".\nSwitzerland is right not to be complacent, said James Galbraith, a professor of government and business relations at the University of Texas, who warns of a potential \"explosion of violence\" on the continent.\n\"Europe is still heading toward a social and human crisis,\" he said. \"In Greece, there's already a breakdown of public order. You have the rise of an essentially fascist organisation that's harassing immigrants.\"\nIf Spain, plagued by regional divisions, leaves the euro, the country could break apart, said Galbraith, who last year wrote Inequality and Instability: A Study of the World Economy Just Before the Great Crisis.\n\"These things have the potential to escalate very rapidly, which is what we saw in Yugoslavia\", where more than 120,000 people died after the state disintegrated in 1991, Galbraith said. \"When I speak of Yugoslavia, it's to remind people that advanced societies have the potential for advanced levels of violence.\"\nMore than 16 kilometres of barbed wire help deter most attacks on Davos and thwart the attentions of anti-globalisation activists. Still, \"there is a certain potential for violence that can't be ignored\", said Halter.\nThe risk that civil unrest in Europe would trigger a flood of refugees into Switzerland is nevertheless slim, said Anand Menon, an associate fellow at Chatham House in London and professor of west European politics at the University of Birmingham. Wide-scale migration requires \"something cataclysmic\", said Menon, who sees Islamic terrorism as a bigger threat, especially since France's intervention in Mali.\nWhile the potential for the euro to collapse shouldn't be taken lightly, Switzerland doesn't have much to fear, according to Galbraith of Texas University.\n\"The prospect of a few Greek refugees turning up in Switzerland shouldn't be particularly alarming,\" he said. \"Some of the unsavoury characters descending on Davos strike me as capable of far more damage.\"\n\nWorld Economic Forum Landmarks\n1979 - The Forum becomes the first NGO to initiate a partnership with China's economic development commissions.\n1988 - Prime Ministers Andreas Papandreou of Greece and Turgut Ozal of Turkey embark on a peace initiative, setting up a crisis \"hot-line\" and vowing to avoid war.\n1994 - Israeli Foreign Minister Shimon Peres and PLO chairman Yasser Arafat talk over the delayed Israeli withdrawal from Gaza and Jericho and one aide talked of \"an atmosphere of compromise\".\n1999 - United Nations Secretary General Kofi Annan announces the Global Compact, to give \"a human face to the global market\".\n2001 - Microsoft boss Bill Gates pledges US$100 million to help develop an African Aids vaccine.\n2002 - The Forum provides a platform for the creation of a Disaster Resource Network, using engineering and transportation firms to assist relief efforts.\n2005 - Actress Sharon Stone raises US$1 million in five minutes for malaria at Davos, while the UK's Tony Blair joins Bono and Bill Gates to pledge aid to Africa.\n2006- The dispute over Iran's nuclear ambitions, militant attacks on oil facilities in Nigeria and Russia's gas disputes with its neighbours raised the profile of energy supply security.\nYou are signed up.

He said he hoped Canada’s largest city was the recipient of the expected US $5 billion project that could result in 50,000 jobs.\nThe prime minister didn’t say what his government was willing to offer to land the project, instead speaking of what he called the “Canadian advantage.”\n“We know that investing in Canada is a smart thing to do in this global economy. We have access to markets around the world with the trade deals we’re signing. We have an educated, diverse workforce that does incredibly great work,” Trudeau said.\n“We’re going to continue to demonstrate why we know that Canada is such a great place to invest. I’m going to continue to make that case to every business leader I meet, including Jeff Bezos.”\nTrudeau’s visit to San Francisco marked the first time in more than 70 years that a Canadian prime minister had come to the city, and his first in-person pitch to Silicon Valley.\nThe goal wasn’t to lure talent away from the region, but to sell Canada as a place to invest, said Rana Sarkar, Canada’s consul general in San Francisco.\n“We are here not to steal jobs from Silicon Valley,” Sarkar said in an interview this week. “We are here to co-create with the tech sector here.”\nTwo years ago when Trudeau took office, Canadian expats who were veterans of Silicon Valley talked to The Canadian Press about the difficult sell their home country faced. In California, salaries, sunshine as well as venture capital were all abundant, and the professional culture more advanced, they said.\nHowever, they also spoke longingly about bringing that culture back home to create the same kind of success in Canada that they experienced in California.\n“The valley is great, but it’s actually not my number-one place where I’m trying to bring talent from,” said Ben Zifkin, who runs a Toronto-based social network for businesses called Hubba.\n“It’s hard to pull people out of that.”\nDonald Trump’s presidency has made the pitch a little easier: all the tough talk about trade deals and immigration has changed the political climate in the United States. Marc Benioff, the CEO of Salesforce, which provides customer-service cloud services to businesses, told Trudeau that “we connect with you on your values,” particularly diversity and openness.\n“The political climate has obviously made Canada more attractive because we’re more diverse, we’re more welcoming and we’re more open,” said Lekan Olawoye, who leads the venture talent development division at the MaRS Discovery District in Toronto.\nCompanies like Microsoft and Amazon have invested in staff in Canada to get around the American visa quotas for overseas workers, said Chris Sands, Director of the Center for Canadian Studies at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore.\n“Canada has been a safety valve for these big companies that are able to bring people from Asia and elsewhere into Canada.”\nTrudeau said his government would continue to fast-track visas for skilled workers in the tech sector, because those companies want to bring more global talent to North America.\n“We know that bringing in great talent from around the world is a tremendous benefit, not just to the companies that want to do that, but to Canadian jobs and to our country as a whole — so we’re going to continue to do that.”\nThe Netherlands has built an island in the North Sea in order to catch wind energy and transport it to Europe. This country has no natural resources, only a well educated work force and great ingenuity and expertise in certain things. It doesn’t seem to have to run around the world begging people to come and invest in it. Why does a rich country like Canada not develop its own people and its own resources. We have huge undeveloped green energy potential (geothermal in BC for an example) and we could create huge numbers of jobs developing it. That’s what we thought Trudeau was going to do.\nOMG ….. Canada is a great place to invest….we have a Government that is pro Unoin/ Big business.\nWe have a week dollar which makes in near impossable to leave once you are in, we have a government that is making it nearly impossible for a person to start a small business.We are taxed to death, we are being forced to use a Gocernment resadential generated lease if you invest in rental property ….. in favour of the tenant.\nShall I go on!\nComments are closed.\nOnly the news you need, from all the sources you know.\niPolitics publishes content everyday, throughout the day.\n© Copyright 2018 iPolitics.

Liu is expected to manage the country’s financial and economic affairs, a major source of friction with the US.\nThe changes come after more than a decade of diminished standing for China’s diplomats in the decision-making structure.\nFrom 1998 until late last year, there were no diplomats in the Communist Party’s powerful Politburo, and state councillor was the most senior rank a diplomat could achieve.\nBut in October an overhaul of the system saw former state councillor Yang Jiechi – the country’s top diplomat – given one of the 25 seats on the Politburo. Liu was also named as a Politburo member.\nChina promotes foreign minister Wang Yi to state councillor, General Wei Fenghe named defence minister\nIn the last month or so, the two new Politburo members have each made trips to the US to try to defuse trade tensions, their seniority a rare gesture of eagerness from Beijing to get relations with Washington back on track.\nA source familiar with the leadership’s diplomatic strategy said Wang Qishan was expected to focus on China’s relations with the US, with Wang Yi reporting to Yang, and Yang reporting to the vice-president.\nIn addition, Wang Qishan will become a member of the Central Leading Group of Foreign Affairs, a party body that oversees international relations.\nChina Foreign Affairs University professor Su Hao said the elevation of Wang Yi to state councillor also meant higher seniority for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.\n“This will give Wang a higher standing to coordinate and mobilise other departments,” Su said.\nWang Yi, who has been foreign minister since 2013, is known for his staunch defence of China’s positions in world affairs.\nChina’s economic mastermind Liu He steps out onto centre-stage at Davos\nHe said it was a “strategic misjudgment” for the US to brand China as a rival, and has also warned Washington not to get involved in China’s disputes with other nations over the South China Sea.\nThere was no mention of Yang’s specific duties at the National People’s Congress on Monday, but foreign ministry spokesman Hua Chunying said Yang would play a key role in China’s diplomacy as a Politburo member.\nSu said he expected Yang would exercise authority over other players in China’s foreign affairs policy, including the commerce ministry and the party’s International Liaison Department, an agency that manages overseas party relations, especially with North Korea.\nSu said that as a state body the foreign ministry had “insufficient coordination” with the party’s International Liaison Department, an administrative issue that could be overcome by Yang’s Politburo standing.\nThe new diplomatic line-up comes amid setbacks in China’s efforts to expand its presence worldwide. Its infrastructure investment projects under Xi’s signature “Belt and Road Initiative” have been seen by many as an attempt by Beijing to lure other nations to its side, undermining the sovereignty of the project recipients.\nChina’s relations with the US are also on the wane. Despite their seniority, Yang and Liu failed to establish proper points of contacts with US officials, and after their trips the White House demanded publicly that China to reduce its trade surplus with the US by US$100 billion.\nChina’s top envoy Yang Jiechi tells Donald Trump: let’s boost coordination on North Korea\nAnd on Friday, US President Donald Trump signed off a law that encourages US officials to visit Taiwan, triggering protests from Beijing that regards the self-ruled island as a wayward province.\nRelations are also complicated by the departure of relative moderates in the White House, including former US secretary of state Rex Tillerson and former economic adviser Gary Cohn, who were replaced by hawkish figures, such as former Central Intelligence Agency director Mike Pompeo.\nFudan University international relations professor Pan Rui said managing China’s relations with the US was the top priority for China’s new foreign policy team.\n“There are a lot of obstacles facing the Sino-US relations. Managing such ties is the biggest challenge for the new team,” Pan said.\nSu said other big jobs would include China’s relations with its neighbours and their growing suspicions of China’s military deployment in the South China Sea.\n\nYou are signed up.

{"title": "Can US pessimism and Chinese optimism find common ground?", "author": "South China Morning Post", "pub_time": "2018年1月30日", "url": "http://www.scmp.com/comment/insight-opinion/article/2131042/can-us-pessimism-and-chinese-optimism-find-common-ground", "content": "\nChina-US relations\nNong Hong says while there may be a consensus that China-US relations have entered a new era, assessments of the change in the bilateral relationship are starkly different in the two countries\nComments:\n\nThe new US National Defence Strategy, announced on January 19, kicked off a fresh round of speculation on US-China relations. The new strategy must be viewed in conjunction with the US National Security Strategy, announced in December, and the “Indo-Pacific” concept raised frequently by US President Donald Trump during his visit to Asia in November – and repeatedly echoed by his foreign policy team. All of this seems to suggest, at least from the US perspective, that American policy towards China has reached a transition point, from “engagement with competition” during previous US administrations to “competition with possible confrontation”. This frustrated and negative assessment seems to diverge greatly from the more optimistic Chinese view of the trajectory of the important bilateral relationship, especially after China’s 19th National Congress last October and Trump’s state visit to China in November.\nIssues such as North Korea’s nuclear tests, trade and economic relations, and strategic competition in Asia’s maritime domain have posed critical challenges to the leaders of both countries, reminding us again of the importance of communication and trust. Trump’s visit to China was reported by the Chinese media as an opportunity to boost Sino-US relations, partly through stable and increasing personal ties between Chinese President Xi Jinping and Trump. On the other hand, many American analysts saw Trump’s visit as a victory for Chinese foreign policy and a loss for the United States. Although Trump’s visit to Asia covered many of the hot issues mentioned above, the perception of analysts in the two countries diverged sharply.\nThe North Korean nuclear crisis and its aftermath has become the No 1 test of US-China relations. There is a consensus among Chinese and US scholars that the crisis affects international security, regional stability and relations between the major powers. It has also been highlighted that the US is willing to consider a preventive war with North Korea as a means of denuclearising the Korean peninsula, which puts China in a difficult position. The fundamental interests of the US and China are not aligned on this issue – the US is happy to squeeze North Korea with military threats and sanctions to the point of collapse, but a chaotic North Korea would be a disaster for China, which stills holds out hope that the crisis can be resolved without war.\nThe Trump administration hasn’t fully grappled with the human and material costs of a preventive strike on North Korea. There is great uncertainty as to where the country’s nuclear assets are stored and a preventive strike would, at best, eliminate a fraction of that capability. Pyongyang’s reprisals thereafter and the outbreak of war could lead to massive casualties.\nThere was a wide consensus that American leadership in Asia and its broader interests in the Asia-Pacific region would suffer lasting damage because of Trump’s mercantilist stance and “America First” economic policy. Such policies are incompatible with the trend of globalisation, which is market-driven and not possible to arrest.\nSome Chinese analysts hold that China’s engagement with the US is likely to receive a positive boost in light of the outcomes of the 19th party congress, at which President Xi reiterated his intention of promoting economic and structural reforms and further opening the Chinese economy to global market forces. This market opening holds out a useful opportunity to further deepen US-China ties and address the criticism directed against China by the US business sector – hitherto China’s most vocal backer – that the playing field is tilted in favour of domestic competitors at the expense of US companies in China. Unfortunately, this optimism in China is not shared in the US.\nIn 2018, the status quo in the South China Sea will be maintained. Important steps were taken towards laying the groundwork for managing these disputes in 2016 and 2017, but any new progress is likely to be slow and reflect changes to the rules of the game that have already been made. The South China Sea issue has taken a back seat to other more immediate concerns, such as the crisis on the Korean peninsula.\nHowever, this does not mean it will go away. The increasing geopolitical competition between China and the US will set the stage for and influence the disputes in the South China Sea. The US navy is likely to conduct freedom of navigation operations more frequently in the South China Sea in 2018. Meanwhile, due to the enhanced capabilities of its navy and recently developed facilities and deployments on some of its South China Sea islands, China will be able to command more effective countermeasures against American military activities in these waters.\nNational rejuvenation, building China into a great, modern socialist country, and realising the “Chinese dream” were signature themes that were reiterated at the 19th party congress. Growth, development and the well-being of the Chinese people will remain the overwhelming focus of the Chinese government and is linked to the greater well-being of the world at large.\nAs the world’s second-largest economy, China needs a predictable and stable strategic environment and has therefore proposed a new system of “major country diplomacy with Chinese characteristics” so that outdated zero-sum hegemonic competitive mentalities can be abandoned. The US, however, did not read such a benign message and instead pointed to contradictions in China’s rhetoric at the 19th party congress. China should communicate in a language that is more easily accessible to its peers – otherwise, the communication will continue to remain one-sided and fruitless.\n\nRecent criticism of “Chinese influence” will also add to the complex dynamic between the two countries. At a roundtable discussion in early January in Washington, some American analysts voiced concern that there is increasing dissatisfaction with the status quo of US-China relations among key US interest groups – labour/manufacturing, the security community, civil society and the China expert community. An example is the University of Texas’ rejection of funding from the China-US Exchange Foundation, a Hong Kong-based organisation that US senator Ted Cruz said “helps spread Chinese government propaganda abroad”.\nThat suspicion was also targeted at Johns Hopkins University, which received funding from the same foundation, although the university clarified that the money came with “absolutely no conditions or limitations”. It will not be surprising to hear of similar stories in the future, which will eventually damage the cultural, educational and people-to-people engagement that helps maintain bilateral relations even in difficult political environments.\n\nThe US seems overwhelmingly pessimistic while China shows extreme optimism about their relationship. This perception gap is driven partially by the respective narratives of each other’s national interests, which give more weight to “competition” than “cooperation” on global and regional security, and partially by domestic issues.\nThe perception gap that has emerged will continue and possibly deepen in 2018, unless the trust deficit is mended through more dialogue and confidence building measures at various levels – from state leaders to different sectors, including security, the military, economy, law enforcement, culture, education, civil society and people-to-people engagement, among others.\nNong Hong, PhD, is executive director and senior fellow at the Institute for China-America Studies (US). www.chinaus-icas.org\nYou are signed up.

He said: ‘We took Jerusalem off the table,’” Erekat continued.\n“The minute any Palestinian goes and meets with American officials, it is an acceptance of their decision. Now they are threatening us with money, with aid.\n“They promised not to impose any solution, and now they want the meeting for the sake of the meeting.”\nErekat said it was as if they were telling the Palestinians, “Come here boy, we know what’s good for you.”\nTrump’s December 6 recognition of Jerusalem as Israel’s capital set off protests among Palestinians, who consider the city to be their capital as well.\n\nErekat’s comments came with rhetoric further sharpening between Trump’s White House and the Palestinians, who have said the United States can no longer mediate in the Middle East conflict and boycotted a recent visit by US Vice President Mike Pence.\nLast week, Trump accused Palestine of disrespecting the United States and threatened to withhold hundreds of millions of dollars in aid until they returned to the negotiating table.\nProvoking Palestinian outrage, he reaffirmed his Jerusalem decision and said the disputed city had been taken “off the table”, despite having previously said his recognition did not preclude later negotiations on its borders.\nTrump made the comments in Davos, Switzerland, while seated next to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.\nAccording to Erekat, the Palestinians – faced with what they see as a blatantly biased US administration – are aiming to convene an international conference in an effort to show global support for a two-state solution to the conflict.\nJerusalem’s status is perhaps the most sensitive issue in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.\nIsrael sees the entire city as its undivided capital, while the Palestinians want the eastern sector as the capital of their future state.\nIsrael occupied east Jerusalem in the 1967 Six-Day War and later annexed it, a move never recognised by the international community.\n\nTrump’s unilateral recognition broke with decades of international consensus that the city’s status must be negotiated between the two sides.\nThe US leader says he still intends to reach what he has called the “ultimate deal” – Israeli-Palestinian peace – but Palestinian president Mahmoud Abbas has called his efforts the “slap of the century”.\nThe Trump administration also hit out at Abbas last week, with UN ambassador Nikki Haley saying he lacked the courage needed for a peace deal.\nErekat likened her comments to a call for a “coup d’etat”.\nYou are signed up.

Indeed, there was no such tryst. In fact, not a single scene brings the two characters face to face in the entire three-hour feature.\n\n“All the controversy about a romantic angle between them was absolutely misplaced,” said Suman Sharma, an architect, after watching the film.\nFellow film-goer Neha Verma also could not understand the fuss, shaking her head as she left the cinema past the cordon of armed police behind shields.\n“It’s a shame that people have been protesting without even bothering to watch it first. The queen has been portrayed so beautifully, no one can raise a finger,” she said.\nDespite the hassle, the effort appeared worth it. As the end credits rolled, the audience erupted into rapturous applause.\nCinema owners in several states declined to screen the big-budget movie – the tale of a mythical Hindu queen who walked into a funeral pyre to avoid capture by a Muslim conqueror – for fear of inciting mobs.\nControversial Bollywood epic opens in Indian cinemas under police guard\nThose worries were well-founded, as scenes of chaos played out across India on the film’s debut day. Mobs burned director Sanjay Leela Bhansali in effigy, blocked motorways with burning tyres and brandished swords at rallies in northern India while phalanxes of police officers were deployed outside cinema halls in Mumbai, New Delhi and other cities.\nThe protesters belonged to India’s Rajput caste who revere Padmavati and insist the film distorts history, even though experts say the queen is a mythical character based on a poem.\n\n\nThe studio, Viacom 18 Motion Pictures, released a statement saying the film – at about US$30 million, one of the most expensive made in India – “captures Rajput valour, dignity and tradition in all its glory.”\nAs the lights dimmed and the film began the audience was informed the film was fiction.\nIt also assured viewers no animals were harmed and the producers did not endorse “sati” – an outlawed ritual of wives throwing themselves onto their husband’s funeral pyre.\nThe radicals staunchly opposed to the film may end up being its biggest saviours: industry watchers predict all the hype will make Padmaavat a box office smash.\n“The hype is only going to work in its favour.

The group also threatened to chop off the nose of actress Deepika Padukone, who plays the queen.\nThis month, one leader of the group in the northwestern state of Rajasthan claimed that 1,900 women had signed up to immolate themselves – in the manner of the fictional queen – if the movie wasn’t banned.\nIndia’s Supreme Court rejects last-ditch effort to ban Bollywood film\nProducers delayed the original December 1 release date, slightly altered the title and added a disclaimer that the film does not claim historical accuracy.\nIndia’s Supreme Court then got involved, ruling that states could not block the film because authorities had an obligation to ensure security.\n\n\nStill, the Multiplex Association of India, an industry body that represents most major theatres nationwide, said this week that its members in four states would not show the movie “in view of the prevailing law and order situation.”\n“What’s paramount for us is the safety of our patrons and the safety of our employees,” the association’s president, Deepak Asher, said in an interview.\nThe Supreme Court said it would take up cases next week against Karni Sena members and against four state governments for failing to control demonstrators.\nAll four – Gujarat, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Haryana – are led by India’s most powerful political party, Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party, or BJP, a Hindu nationalist organisation.\nHindu extremists threaten to torch British cinemas showing Bollywood film\nCritics have questioned why state officials were unable to maintain order and accuse Modi’s allies of coddling right-wing Hindu extremists.\nOne BJP official in Haryana, Surajpal Amu, was reportedly placed under house arrest on Thursday for comments he made in November, when he put up a US$1.5 million prize for chopping off the heads of Bhansali and Padukone.\n\n“It is beyond horrible,” Tavleen Singh, a columnist who supports Modi, wrote on Twitter. “Why is there such a collapse of law and order in BJP states?

They are barred from doing so at present, but investors in Hong Kong can buy bonds in the mainland market.\n“I think that there is probably more that the government can do ... to better connect with global capital markets,” Zhou said.\n“China is pushing ahead with convertibility in a steady and gradual manner,” he said. “There are some restrictions, and these restrictions will be removed gradually.”\nChina’s central bank chief Zhou Xiaochuan ‘headed for Boao Forum’, Asia’s Davos\nIris Pang, an economist with ING, said as the face of financial reform in China, Zhou was using his last days in the job to promote modernised, market-based governance.\nBut it is an open question whether Zhou’s liberal ideas will be followed amid fears the country is heading down an authoritarian path, with President Xi Jinping set to secure the right to rule indefinitely under a proposed change to the constitution.\n“Zhou has been consistent throughout his career in pushing forward reform – to liberalise the interest and exchange rates, and free convertibility of yuan. But when he retires, he’ll leave big shoes to fill when it comes to further liberalisation of the market, and risk prevention will be crucial,” Pang said.\nIn terms of defusing the domestic debt bomb, Zhou said the worst time had passed.\n“China has entered a period of stabilising leverage or gradually reducing leverage,” said Zhou, 70, who is due to retire in the coming days. “This trend is clear.”\nThat contrasts with his reading in October, when he warned against complacency and the dangers of a “Minsky moment”, a term coined by US economist Hyman Minsky to describe a sudden collapse of asset prices after long periods of prosperity or growth.\nZhou cited the fact that China’s money supply growth rate was now below the nominal GDP growth rate to indicate that Beijing had brought the growth of debt under control, and that its efforts to control risks were paying off.\nChina’s broad money supply, or M2, rose 8.8 per cent at the end of February from a year earlier, up from 8.6 per cent at the end of January. The nominal value of GDP rose 11.2 per cent to 82.7 trillion yuan (US$13.05 trillion) in 2017, from 74.4 trillion yuan in 2016.\nChina’s battle plan against tycoons prompts Xiao Jianhua firm to sell US$23 billion of assets\nWhile outstanding bank loans have continued to rise, Zhou said that was partly because China’s crackdown on shadow banking had revealed debts on the balance sheets of banks.\n“You can’t use just one indicator to claim that, look, China is still adding leverage,” he said.\nChinese banks extended 839.3 billion yuan in net new yuan loans in February, the central bank said on Friday, a sharp drop from January’s 2.9 trillion yuan.\nAt the briefing, asked whether China would follow the US Federal Reserve in raising interest rates, Zhou’s deputy Yi Gang said the decision would be based on the domestic economic situation.\nYi said the “actual interest rate” was stable and in line with economic fundamentals.\nZhou, who played a key role in securing nominal international reserve currency status for the yuan from the International Monetary Fund, said China could be “bolder” in opening up its financial sector as the country had entered a “new cycle” of growth. The IMF included the yuan in its basket of special drawing rights currencies in 2016, alongside the US dollar, euro, yen and the pound.\nChina’s belt and road plan is a major debt risk for weak economies, report says\nAfter a period of draconian control over capital outflows in the past two years, Beijing is starting to loosen its grip. It is discussing a new stock connect programme with London that would allow investors from the two sides to make direct transactions. The government is also working on the details of a plan to allow Chinese tech firms listed in the US to “return” to the domestic stock market.\nZhou said it would not be difficult to open the “southbound” channel of the bond connect scheme with Hong Kong, but he did not say when it might happen.\nThe link was launched in the middle of last year and allows eligible institutional investors in Hong Kong and overseas to buy and sell onshore bonds without a quota through what is termed “northbound” trade. The Shanghai and Shenzhen stock markets also have two-way connects with the Hong Kong bourse.\nHong Kong dollar falls further with monetary authority poised to intervene to prop up currency\nMeanwhile, Zhou said Beijing would not interfere with Hong Kong’s management of its currency and peg to the US dollar. The Hong Kong dollar has weakened to its lowest level in 30 years, edging towards the 7.85 lower limit of a narrow trading band which the city’s de facto central bank, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, is obliged to maintain. A currency peg against the greenback since October 1983 has kept the Hong Kong dollar relatively stable. But that stability has recently been challenged as investors sell Hong Kong dollars ahead of a meeting later this month of the US Federal Reserve.\n“We won’t make any policy recommendations to Hong Kong regarding Hong Kong’s fiscal and monetary policy,” Zhou said. But he added that the recent Hong Kong dollar weakness was “within expectations” and said Beijing would “coordinate” with Hong Kong if necessary.\nThe Chinese government is sitting on US$3.1 trillion of foreign exchange reserves, the world’s largest forex stockpile. In February, the foreign exchange reserves fell for first time in 13 months, but Zhou said that was mainly due to fluctuations in the US dollar value.\nAdditional reporting by Maggie Zhang\nYou are signed up.

Yes, it looks like it may be “back to the future” again, as in ... war preparation.\nThe Trump administration has revealed defence priorities that have the chilling feel of a cold war emphasis – rather than a no-war aspiration. The world has just been told that the 2019 Pentagon budget – topped up at US$716 billion – comes packaged as an “aggressive defence strategy”. Defence Secretary James “Mad Dog” Mattis, viewed as one of this bizarre administration’s more balanced brains, cites threats from China and Russia. Both political left and right, argue some US think-tank types, seem in increasing concurrence on two nostrums. One is that the Indo-Pacific region is the globe’s number one geopolitical theatre (agree). The second is that America must do much more to counter an “increasingly authoritarian, mercantilist and aggressive” China.\nWho knows what the US now wants, but what is worrisome is the ever-hovering Law of Unintended Consequences: one builds up for peace but winds up with war.\nThis depressing drift reflects conceptual minimalism – an ideology of win-lose, the default of us-vs-them, and rejection of visionary global leadership for petty policy provincialism. “America First does not mean America alone”, President Donald Trump insisted at the World Economic Forum summit in Davos, Switzerland. “When the United States grows, so does the world.” But how can that be the case if it grows small-minded?\nSmall minds tend not to beget big ideas. One of America’s great diplomats was the late George Kennan, who coined – and mostly even defined – the iconic policy of “containment” as the needed antidote to the poison of the former Soviet Union. And though Kennan’s excoriation of Soviet communism never waned one bit at Princeton University’s Woodrow Wilson School, where he retired to become an unforgettable teacher, the true genius of the containment notion was its aim: not to provoke uncertainty but offer a bedrock of predictability.\nBut when the USSR collapsed from internal decay, the simplicity of this organising idea went poof as well. One day, out of frustration, a few Washington influentials trekked to Princeton hoping the master might give birth to a new trope, as it were, to reframe US policy. But according to dinner participants (alas, I was not present), Kennan resisted the challenge with the sigh that world was exploding in too many directions for conceptual miniaturisation. At the same time Kennan, who died in 1995 aged 101, had little appetite to advise anyone to go “back to the future”.\nThe provincialism of Trump is a symptom of the current default to the past, including tariff tantrums and potential trade wars that will harm US consumers as well as foreign producers; but he is not the core cause. The new provincialism goes deep: after all, Trump’s more thoughtful predecessor preferred “leading from behind”. But whether from the back or front, Asian nations from the Philippines to Vietnam – and perhaps also Singapore and Malaysia – need the US to act with intelligence and foresight. What is needed is a committed effort to formulate a cosmopolitan internationalism, fiendishly multisided; but rarely is anything truly important easy to achieve.\n\nThe problem with the win-lose paradigm is that someone always loses; the argument for win-win is, “why risk being a loser”? It should not be hard to decide which of these two approaches offers the best odds for geopolitical and economic stability. This outlook would prove less difficult to realise were it matched by an expansive dose of cosmopolitanism from China. Americans worry – and increasingly so – that Beijing is striking a more global posture than Washington but the new “nice” hegemon profile is but a pose. One Harvard professor even titled his latest book (superb, other than the awful title): Destined for War.\nChina will stumble if it needlessly brews its own cold war rumble. Big powers advance best with little steps. This sensitive point was conveyed at Davos. Singapore’s tactful minister, Chan Chun Sing, came across as more than happy to accept China’s imaginative and ambitious New Silk Road programme as a credible potential trigger for our world economy’s “next phase of growth”. But – seemed the minister’s subtext – Beijing needs to stop scaring people in the Asian neighbourhood half out of their wits if it proposes to begin “leading from the front” with élan. Said Chan: “I can understand and I have heard theories where people are afraid, hesitant about China’s growth. But this is an important historical opportunity for China to convince the rest of the world that actually its actions have a broader perspective ... The Chinese have a saying: yi de fu ren – use your benevolence to bring about a global community.”\nThis felicitous phrase was the one trumpeted by President Xi Jinping in his Davos speech last year. The optics of the current Chinese government plumping for an expansive internationalism contrasted brilliantly – and cleverly – with the self-centred darkness of the then newly inaugurated American president. And it still does. Back to the future – if America is prepared to go small conceptually, while blowing up militarily? Or boldly into the future goes China – yi de fu ren? That’s the daunting, haunting mystery of our era.\nLoyola Marymount University Professor Tom Plate’s books on China include the recent Yo-Yo Diplomacy and In the Middle of China’s Future (with an introduction by Kishore Mahbubani)\nYou are signed up.

{"title": "Why the US should be wary of Xi Jinping's power consolidation", "author": "South China Morning Post", "pub_time": "2018年3月3日", "url": "http://www.scmp.com/comment/insight-opinion/article/2135439/why-us-should-be-wary-xi-jinpings-power-consolidation", "content": "\nXi Jinping\nJames Stavridis says Xi Jinping’s power consolidation offers the possibility of a strong and stable China, but without an outlet, internal pressures may boil over or external threats such as the US may become the focus\nComments:\n\nThe last emperor of China, Pu Yi, abdicated in 1912. He was the 12th emperor of the historically important Qing dynasty, which lasted 267 years. With his departure, two millenniums of empire, usually with a single individual dominating all of China, ended. Since then, the nation has moved toward an authoritarian system under Communist Party control, but has frequently changed leaders since the death in 1976 of Mao Zedong. Over recent decades, the party has observed a limit of two five-year terms – a system that has provided reasonable stability while also allowing some level of change. That era seems to be ending.\nIn an increasingly predicted manoeuvre, the Chinese Central Committee is likely to formally abolish the term limit on presidential power, creating the conditions for the incumbent, Xi Jinping, to remain in office indefinitely. Xi will also be bringing in his long-term associate Wang Qishan as vice-president, further hampering younger officials from developing centres of political power. This has been foreshadowed for at least two years in a series of “power moves” by Xi, ranging from the harsh anti-corruption campaign (headed by the 69-year-old Wang) that eliminated many rivals, to his appearing in military garb at official events, stressing his control over the People’s Liberation Army.\nWhile Xi had already established himself as the most powerful Chinese leader since Deng Xiaoping, this latest move is still a radical change, presenting both opportunities and challenges.\nIn terms of opportunity, Xi has demonstrated that he is a competent, serious, balanced leader who has improved the economy, enhanced China’s global reach, strengthened its already significant military capability, and reduced corruption – a significant set of achievements in the public’s eyes. With his potential to rule China for another decade or longer, China will experience a steady hand on the tiller of public policy.\nXi’s popularity is already strong, and this move – at least in the short term – will enhance his already powerful public persona. Finally, the 64-year-old Xi’s presumed longevity will provide China a leader with a clear, boldly stated strategic goal for its expanding role on the global stage. He laid this out in a speech at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, roughly a year ago.\nBut there will be challenges as well. No matter how competent and effective a leader he is, Xi will be faced with several knotty problems: a badly damaged environment, a super-heated real estate market, badly skewed gender demographics (more men than women), geopolitical and international legal disputes over the South China Sea, and an ageing population. When growth begins to slow significantly, which it must over time, these irritants in the political and economic system will build up internal pressures and create political discontinuities, as they have in other authoritarian societies.\nThis presents the greatest risk for China. In the end, democracy, for all its flaws and shortcomings, is a safety valve for society when things become frustrating or go wrong – and something always goes wrong. Democracy allows the people to change leaders without bloodshed and anarchy. The Chinese people have been relatively content with their authoritarian system while hitting growth targets of 10 per cent annually, building glittering new infrastructure, moving millions out of the countryside and into the urban settings, and lifting hundreds of millions of people out of poverty. But what will happen when internal pressures grow and there is no mechanism to change leaders?\nFrom the US perspective, Xi’s consolidation of power will make China an even more formidable competitor both within East Asia and globally. Countries in the neighbourhood – most of which are US allies, partners or friends – will see a single, powerful figure at the top of the Chinese leadership structure and be more inclined to enter into cooperative agreements with what they correctly view as a stable power. Globally, over the long term, authoritarian leaders also have advantages over the revolving door of real democracy. They gather decades of experience and can develop ambitious strategic plans that they will execute themselves.\nContrast this with the US tendency to whipsaw in policy when administrations change – for example, Barack Obama and the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade agreement, followed by Donald Trump’s complete rejection of the treaty and tendency to blame China for the US’ economic problems. Washington will have to respond with an overarching strategy for dealing with China that transcends individual administrations. This will be challenging but not impossible: the idea of containment against the Soviet Union (obviously not the right approach for China) in the cold war, for example, was a consistent pillar of foreign policy for decades of presidents.\nPerhaps most worrisome is the possibility that if Xi eventually comes under serious domestic pressure, he may be inclined to create external threats to maintain his own popularity. Authoritarian leaders like Hugo Chavez in Venezuela and Vladimir Putin in Russia have done so, painting the US as a nefarious enemy. A hypernationalist turn in Beijing could lead to confrontation between the US and China, and a path towards the so-called Thucydides Trap, in which a rising power confronts an existing power – a dynamic that has led so often to war over the past 2,400 years. It will take diplomacy, economic cooperation and leadership on both sides to avoid this.\nOne of the most iconic novels in the long history of China was written in the mid-18th century: The Dream of the Red Chamber, by Cao Xueqin. It is a huge, sprawling depiction of Chinese society under the Qing dynasty, when rival families fought for power in a complex hierarchy under a powerful emperor, with a vastly changing international environment as backdrop. The lesson is that influence rooted in friendship with the emperor (who is never actually named in this dreamy novel) is fragile and uncertain. Much as in the Red Chamber, leaders in China will have to manoeuvre in a deeply complex internal world, even as China emerges as a fully formed leading actor on the global stage. This will challenge Western democracies at every level. Let us hope we are ready.\nJames Stavridis is a Bloomberg columnist.

Solange die Asiaten nicht Informationen über ihre Aktionäre vorlegten, werde Washington keine Investitionen der HNA genehmigen, sagte eine mit dem Vorgang vertraute Person der Nachrichtenagentur Reuters.\nSollten die US-Behörden tatsächlich eingreifen, wären die Investments der HNA beim US-Hedgefonds SkyBridge Capital LLC und dem in der Schweiz ansässigen Rohstoffhändler Glencore in Gefahr. Beide Deals werden derzeit von US-Behörden geprüft. SkyBridge und Glencore wollten sich zu dem Thema nicht äußern, bei HNA war zunächst niemand für eine Stellungnahme zu erreichen. Ende November hatte HNA wegen falscher und unvollständiger Angaben beim Kauf der Schweizer Flug-Cateringfirma Gategroup die Aufmerksamkeit der Schweizer Aufsichtsbehörde auf sich gezogen; im Dezember blockierte Neuseeland die Übernahme einer Tochter der Großbank Australia and New Zealand Banking Group.\nAm Freitag setzte außerdem das vierte HNA-Tochterunternehmen, der Reiseveranstalter HNA-Caissa Travel Group, innerhalb von zehn Tagen den Wertpapierhandel an der Börse aus. Hainan Airlines und Tianjin Tianhai Capital waren die ersten beiden, Bohai Capital folgte Mitte dieser Woche. Die Begründungen reichten von „großen Veränderungen“, die anstünden, bis zu „wichtigen Restrukturierungsmaßnahmen der Anlagen“.\nAußerdem will sich das Unternehmen von seinem Mehrheitsanteil an der spanischen NH Hotel Group trennen, teilte es am Freitag mit. Mehrere Banken seien damit beauftragt worden, nach Interessenten für die Hotelkette zu suchen. Die Beteiligung von 29,5 Prozent wird nach aktuellen Preisen mit rund 632 Millionen Euro bewertet.\nMehrere Nachrichtenagenturen berichteten zudem, dass HNA-Geschäftsführer Adam Tan seine Teilnahme am Weltwirtschaftsforum, der nächste Woche in Davos stattfindet, abgesagt habe. Ein Grund dafür wurde nicht genannt. Die chinesische Delegation besteht bisher aus Staatspräsident Xi Jinping, dem Vorsitzenden des E-Kommerz-Riesen Alibaba, Jack Ma, dem Präsidenten des Internet-Riesen Baidu, Zhang Yaqin, und dem Vorsitzenden des Autoherstellers Guangzhou Automobile Gruppe, Zeng Qinghong.\nC-Quadrat-Gründer Alexander Schütz: „HNA ist sehr zufrieden mit der Deutsche-Bank-Aktie“\nAm Donnerstag sagte der HNA-Vorsitzende Chen Feng in einem Interview mit Reuters, dass die Unternehmensgruppe ihre Probleme schrittweise lösen werde und man die Unterstützung der Banken und anderer Finanzinstitute habe. 2018 plane man „effizienter“ zu werden.\nDer chinesische Konzern sieht sich immer größerem Druck von sowohl staatlicher wie auch finanzieller Seite ausgesetzt: Im Sommer kritisierte die chinesische Regierung heimische Unternehmen für ihre Einkaufstouren im Ausland und nannte unter anderem auch die schuldenfinanzierten Akquisen der HNA als Negativbeispiel. Der Mischkonzern hatte in den drei Jahren zuvor Anlagen im Wert von circa 40 Milliarden US-Dollar außerhalb Chinas aufgekauft. Zum Jahresende 2017 gab es immer mehr Meldungen über Liquiditätsengpässe, ausstehende Rückzahlungen und eingefrorene Kreditlinien.\nÜber die österreichische Vermögensverwaltung C-Quadrat ist HNA mit 9,9 Prozent an der Deutschen Bank beteiligt. Die Probleme befeuerten zuletzt Spekulationen, dass die Chinesen ihren Deutsche-Bank-Anteil versilbern könnten. Doch HNA wies dies zurück. „Die Deutsche Bank ist ein Kerninvestment für HNA, die Beteiligung hat einen hohen Prestige-Faktor“, hatte der Vertreter von HNA im Aufsichtsrat, Alexander Schütz, Ende Dezember im Handelsblatt-Interview gesagt. HNA habe kein Interesse an einem Verkauf.\nDas Kommentieren dieses Artikels wurde deaktiviert.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

TVB, founded in November 1967, said it may consider revisiting the buy-back plan “at an appropriate time.”\nThe buy-back proposal, part of a restructuring plan to revitalise the city’s oldest television network for the internet age, was controversial because it challenged Hong Kong’s broadcast ordinance, which stipulated that only local residents can be the beneficiary controller of a license.\nLi, founder and chairman of the China Media Capital (CMC) group, hails from Shanghai, and served as an official in the city’s government before entering business. CMC exerts its control over TVB through an entity called Young Lion Holdings, which owns 26 per cent of the Hong Kong broadcaster.\nUnder the buy-back proposal, Young Lion would expand its stake in TVB to 41.19 per cent. Normally this would necessitate a formal takeover bid, but Li requested for a waiver from the Securities and Futures Commission.\nThe buy-back was opposed by TVB’s second-largest shareholder, UK-based hedge fund Silchester International.\nIn an earlier ruling on the buy-back, the SFC’s takeovers and mergers panel said that Young Lion needed to disclose more details around its ownership structure. The Communications Authority said in May 2017 that it was examining whether any relevant information may have been held back and undisclosed during the process of considering TVB’s applications for shareholding changes as Li bought his stake.\nIn October 2017, TVB said that it was informed by the Communications Authority, which has been looking into the proposed buy-back, that it would not rule on the buy-back until the earlier applications to restructure TVB’s ownership from 2015 and 2016 were resolved satisfactorily.\nThe broadcaster said then that if the Communications Authority had not come to a judgement on these before 23 January 2018, it would ask that the offer be allowed to lapse.\n“The authority had neither come to a judgement on these matters, nor was there any certainty about the timeline for it doing so,” according to TVB’s statement.\nAs a result, the broadcaster said that it had applied to the SFC executive asking for its consent not to proceed with the buy back offer.\nTVB will continue to assist the city’s telecoms regulator with its assessment of the 2015 and 2016 applications to bring the assessment to a conclusion as soon as possible, the company said. It also said that it would continue to evaluate various options for the company including revisiting the buy-back or an “alternative transaction,” without elaborating.\nYou are signed up.

{"title": "Why Uber Was Right Not to Hire a Female CEO", "author": "Fortune", "pub_time": "2017年8月30日", "url": "http://fortune.com/2017/08/30/new-uber-ceo-dara-khosrowshahi/", "content": "After a lengthy search, Uber has finally landed on a new CEO: former Expedia (EXPE) CEO Dara Khosrowshahi. In his first week, he faces a handful of corporate nightmares, ranging from infighting board members to a lawsuit from Alphabet, Inc. over driverless cars to suspicions from foreign regulators about Uber’s business practices. He also inherits the fallout from months of negative headlines and the company’s ailing corporate culture—begging the head-scratching question: Why would anyone want that job?\nAccording to many sources, Uber’s search for a new chief was narrowed down to three top candidates, including HP (HPE) CEO Meg Whitman, former General Electric (GE) head Jeff Immelt, and Khosorowshahi. Many of us hoped Uber would select a woman CEO to lead the beleaguered organization out of scandal. On the surface, hiring a woman seemed like the obvious strategy for replacing Uber’s former head bro in charge, Travis Kalanick. The public might have perceived the appointment of a female leader at Uber as a giant leap forward for the organization, which is still reeling from the side effects of intense sexual harassment investigations, sketchy global business practices, unhappy drivers, discrimination within the company ranks, and sexist behavior within its board. But Uber’s new CEO is a man.\nWhile Khosrowshahi does little to improve perceptions of gender inclusiveness at Uber, he does add a new perspective to the company’s leadership, which is an imperative for Uber to rescue its brand. Hiring a woman for Uber’s top job could have made the company telegraph an enlightened and transformed brand image, but such a move could have just as easily backfired by appearing insincere and banal. Uber didn’t need to add one more potential scandal to an already lengthy list. Khosrowshahi’s appointment appears to be a compromise from a deeply divided board, but he’s likely the best candidate to extinguish the raging dumpster fire at Uber.\nAn Iranian immigrant who faced significant discrimination throughout his life, Khosrowshahi has an impressive resume. During the past 30 years, he’s been an investment banker, CEO, and CFO. He has lots of tricks up his sleeve, and he’s going to need them all to help the company overcome its business challenges and repair its brand. When Khosrowshahi became CEO of Expedia in 2005, he took big risks to patiently rebuild the company’s entire business model from the ground-up, shifting from the “merchant” practice of reselling hotel rooms, to an “agency” model, in which Expedia actually gets paid on commission for connecting guests with rooms via the site. His patience in identifying and repairing problems at their root could be helpful for Uber as it rebuilds.\nKhosrowshahi is also credited with having a calm and collected demeanor and deep connections within the tech industry—both potential leadership assets for a recovering Uber. The new CEO has a long punch list that includes filling up the executive ranks, fending off regulators and lawsuits, mending relationships with drivers, managing an unruly board of directors, and ultimately turning a profit. But perhaps his greatest assignment will be to repair the broken corporate culture that seems to be at the core of all Uber’s troubles. If Uber’s current brand were a person, it’d be that obnoxious, smart-alecky teenager who walks across your flower beds, flipping you the bird at you when you tell him to stay off your lawn. For Uber to compete effectively on a global stage and grow into its potential as a company with an estimated $70 billion valuation and a keen desire to go public, it needs to grow up fast.\nCorporate culture is indelibly linked to an organization’s brand. A brand is the relationship and experience a company creates for everyone with whom it interacts, at every touchpoint—in Uber’s case, that’s employees to drivers, drivers to riders, employees to employees, and so on—so you can’t have a brand without a culture. When your culture is in distress, so is your brand. It’s been well acknowledged that Uber has a sick corporate culture that’s persisted unchecked by leadership for many years.\nKhosrowshahi, with everything he’s experienced, what he stands for, and what he can do, will help Uber exit its witless, mulish adolescence and develop into the mature young it needs to become. In addition to having a proven track record in leading companies through change, Khosrowshahi was one of the first executives to openly condemn President Trump’s January 2017 travel ban. He’s also a polished and disciplined adult—the perceptual antithesis to Kalanick’s “tech-bro” persona. While Khosrowshahi may have been the compromise candidate, here’s hoping he’s the complete package in a CEO to lead Uber out of its crises.\nDeb Gabor is the author of Branding is Sex: Get Your Customers Laid and Sell the Hell Out of Anything, and founder of Sol Marketing.\n"}

For countries raking part in the initiative, especially emerging economies or countries in need of investment, “Xi has tried to bring a positive message on economic opportunities provided by China coming without political strings attached”, he said.\nSteve Tsang, director of the SOAS China Institute in London, said Xi likened the initiative’s member countries to an extended family in Chinese tradition, but did not specify who should take the lead in the group.\n“Is it not obvious? Countries neighbouring China that are ­involved may well feel they are requested and required to join. Countries further afield no doubt see this as a gravy train and don’t want to miss out,” Tsang said.\nWhile leaders from 29 out of 64 countries covered by the initiative gathered in Beijing, most developed nations, including the US, remain suspicious of China’s ­efforts, sending delegations led by lower-level officials or representatives instead. India skipped the two-day gathering over concerns about warming ties between China and Pakistan.\nAcutely aware of mounting concerns over rising protectionism, Xi touted China’s contributions to global economic stability.\nXi also spent much of his speech trying to allay unease about China’s rising diplomatic, economic and military assertiveness, describing his signature foreign policy push as “inclusive”.\nAnalysts said Xi’s message on greater openness and adherence to the principles of free trade dovetailed with his Davos speech.\nThey said domestic political considerations also loomed large at the forum, which comes in the lead-up to the Communist Party’s national congress in the autumn.\n“For domestic audiences, it was important for Xi to project his image as a confident and visionary leader being able to roll out an ambitious strategy that would appeal to the outside world,” ­Gabuev said.\nNever mind the ‘Belt and Road’ cash, what about China’s growing clout?\nTsang also said Xi appeared to have articulated an obvious desire to play a more proactive leadership role, but on Chinese terms.\n“He avoids giving any indication as to how countries should resolve their differences if their core interests conflict with each other,” he said.\nTsang said Xi fell short of spelling out his ambitions to rewrite the global rules of the game but Beijing was unlikely to allow China’s core interests to go unmet should they conflict with other countries, such as those from Central or Southeast Asia.\nGabuev said: “It is very important to remember that the initiative doesn’t have any criteria for success.”\nAdditional reporting by Jane Cai\nYou are signed up.

He’s like a dog with a bone on this trade issue.”\nChina’s government this week backed down from forcing foreign manufacturers to transfer their technology to local partners for market access, a practise that Beijing doesn’t acknowledge exists, even though foreign companies in automotive, semiconductor and new-energy batteries had been complaining about it for years.\n“We will fully open up the manufacturing sector, with no mandatory technology transfers required, and we will protect intellectual property,” Chinese Premier Li Keqiang said this week during his press conference marking the end of China’s annual legislative meetings in Beijing.\nChina will also open up industries including aged care, education and financial services to overseas investments, remove foreign equity ceilings in some areas, while gradually cutting market access restrictions, Li said, without indicating when these changes would happen.\nOpinion: A silver lining is in the clouds if the economies of China, Asia can pull through the immediate squall\n“Certainly, tech transfer and intellectual property are at the forefront of the issues that the [US] Trade Representative is  looking at to determine how far we have to go to start the correction,” Priebus said. “First and foremost on the president’s agenda is the issue of trade imbalance.”\nTo defuse the trade row, Chinese President Xi Jinping dispatched two senior officials over two months from the Communist Party’s most powerful decision-making body, the Politburo, to the US.\n“The US is likely to address its main beef with Beijing - the lack of equal and reciprocal access for US businesses selling their goods and services in China - instead of cutting off those Chinese exports that are sought after by American consumers,” said John Woods, the Asia-Pacific chief investment officer of Credit Suisse, in Hong Kong. “Expect China to grant greater access to selected markets for US companies, set in place agencies and monitoring systems to increase protection of US intellectual property rights, and further step up commitments to buy more US-made goods to reduce the trade deficit somewhat.”\nHowever, both the February visit by China’s top diplomat Yang Jiechi, and the visit earlier this month by vice-premier Liu He, failed to yield results. The US imposed a 25 per cent tariff on steel and 10 per cent levy on aluminium on March 2.\n“As I understand it, there has been a lot of talk, but not a lot of action,” said Priebus, who was chairman of the Republican Party for six years before joining the Trump White House as chief of staff in 2017, a job he held for six months until the president fired him with a tweet. “So the president decided to take things into his own hands and said, ‘We’ll do something about steel and aluminium. The next thing we’ll do is on technology and intellectual property rights.’ That’s how we got to where we are today.”\n\nThe origins of Trump’s reciprocal tax idea, which he referred to in offhand remarks on February 12 during a White House event on infrastructure, are unclear. Reciprocity exists in US personal income tax, particularly between Midwest and East Coast states where large sections of the workforce live and work across state boundaries. Reciprocity agreements between states exempt workers from paying taxes twice.\n“The whole idea of a reciprocal tax is fairness,” Priebus said. “Trade fairness is what he cares about the most. If you tax our motorbikes at 25 per cent, we will tax your motorbikes at 25 per cent. That’s generally what the president’s view is.”\nTrump didn’t elaborate on his initial remarks. An administration official later tried to walk back the president’s comment, clarifying that no such tax was in the works, and the president was simply reiterating sentiments he has long held, according to a Bloomberg report.\nIronically, a piece of US legislation called the Reciprocal Tariff Act, enacted in 1934 by President Franklin D. Roosevelt to facilitate trade negotiations with different countries - particularly Latin America - was credited with ending the post-Great Depression protectionism in America and ushering in the decades of trade liberalisation that persist until today.\nUS import duties would plunge under the Roosevelt law, declining from an average of 46 per cent in 1934 to 12 per cent by 1962, according to a 1997 report in World Politics.\n“The US and China buy different products from each other; China buys more machineries, aircraft and agricultural products from the US, while the US imports more electronics and consumer goods from China,” said Aidan Yao, the senior emerging Asia economist at AXA Investment Managers in Hong Kong. “That’s how comparative advantage in trade works.”\nChina is the largest creditor nation to the US, with the world’s biggest holdings of US Treasuries at US$1.168 trillion at the end of January.\nOpinion: The Trump White House needs capable China hands to guide its US foreign policy\nIn dealing with China - on every issue from the economy, to diplomacy, climate change and terror - the Trump team relies on a handful of people for advise. They include US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer, Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross, former Director of the National Economic Council Gary Cohn and his successor Larry Kudlow, Director of the National Trade Council Peter Navarro, and Matt Pottinger, a former Reuters journalist who’s now a member of the National Security Council, Priebus said.\nStill, it may all be part of the businessman’s art of pursuing the deal.\n“His approach is to put all the chips on the table, and put people on their heels so that the negotiations can begin,” Priebus said. “He will bilaterally settle with some countries, including China.”\nYou are signed up.

Some 3,000 legislators are scheduled to discuss the candidates for the governorship on Sunday.\nAnalysts said the dramatic shift will largely raise the PBOC’s status, while making the banking and insurance regulators the executors of policies, now to be set by the bank.\n“By shifting power to the PBOC, it will help avoid conflicting policy signals sent from different regulators, and other problems brought about by cross regulation,” said Ma Jun, former chief economist at the central bank’s research bureau.\nIs China’s central bank boss Zhou Xiaochuan about to retire?\nThe final shortlist of front runners to win the bank’s top job are current Politburo member Liu He, the top economic adviser and close ally to President Xi Jinping, the PBOC’s current deputy governor Yi Gang and de facto major policymaker, and Xie Fuzhan, a veteran economist and now party chief of central China’s Henan province.\nLiu, 66, is widely expected to become vice-premier, in charge of economic and financial affairs after the deliberations of the National People’s Congress (NPC), according to people familiar with the matter. That would put him on a par with Zhu Rongji, known for his tough approach to tackling what some saw as the economic chaos, when he was vice-premier and central bank governor between 1993 and 1995.\n\nLiu is also widely expected to head the cabinet-level Financial Stability and Development Committee, founded last year to supersede all financial regulators.\n“The set up of the committee is a 100 per cent China invention that has no counterparts overseas,” said Zhou Hao, senior emerging markets economist at Commerzbank. “A political body that rides over the traditional financial regulatory regime, chaired by Xi’s top adviser and strong ally Liu He, will ensure a more centralised and consolidated decision-making process, and top-down implementation of the will from ‘the central’ [government in Beijing].”\n‘Be bolder’: Chinese central bank chief Zhou Xiaochuan looks back as he heads for the exit\nThat leaves deputy governor Yi Gang, 60, the most likely successor to Zhou Xiaochuan as the next governor. Yi is a fluent English speaker, having spent eight years in the United States completing his doctorate in econometrics and teaching at Indiana University. His succession to Zhou - China’s longest-serving central banker - will allow for a smoother transition as he has already been making major decisions for the PBOC’s daily operation and is also a familiar face to overseas peers, economists said.\nXie Fuzhan, the 64-year-old Henan party chief and former statistician, also has an outside chance, having spent almost two decades at the research centre under the State Council.\nHe also used to be a member of the top internal economic think tank to the leadership, and like Liu was a member of the central bank’s monetary policy committee from 2006 to 2008. The committee, which recommends monetary policies to the leadership, is the country’s most prestigious advisory body on economic matters.\n\nXie studied at Princeton University, Harvard University, and the University of Cambridge. But some people argue he stands only an outside chance because his early career owed its allegiance to former premier Wen Jiabao. From 2008 to 2013 when Xie was heading the Cabinet’s research office, he was involved in drafting all major policy speeches by the premier.\nChina’s central bank chief lays out plans to avert future financial crisis\nGuo Shuqing and Jiang Chaoliang, two early candidates said to be in the running for the top central bank job, appear to have lost their chances, according to people familiar with the matter. Guo, a former foreign exchange administrator and top official in two Chinese province, also worked at the central bank, in addition to having worked in commercial banks. He is now most likely to become head of the merged banking-insurance regulator, sources said.\nJiang, a former executive at the China Development Bank and the Agricultural Bank of China, will most likely remain in his post as the top Communist Party official in Hubei province, continuing in the role he’d only taken over in October 2016 for more political experience, sources said.\nZhou, the 11th central bank governor since the People’s Bank was established in 1949, has been in the top job for 15 years. The chemical engineer-turned-economist, now 70, has finished “80 per cent of his work” on the reforms and liberalisation of interest rates and exchange rate, using his “distinctive style of gradual but persistent liberalisation” that balances politics and a technocrat’s expertise, said Chen Long, a Beijing-based economist with consultancy Gavekal.\nThe biggest challenge faced by Zhou’s successor would be the taming of China’s freewheeling banking industry and ridding the sector of what the president called “systematic financial risks.”\nChina’s financial system is still awash with the spillover effects of the government’s 4 trillion yuan economic stimulus to prop up the economy after the 2008 Global Financial Crisis. Combined with China’s economic growth that averaged 9.2 per cent per annum, the banking system ballooned tenfold in value to 240 trillion yuan (US$38 trillion) during Zhou’s tenure. China’s economy surpassed Japan as the world’s second-largest, while the Chinese central bank amassed the biggest holdings of US Treasuries to become America’s No. 1 creditor nation -- all during Zhou’s tenure.\nThat expansion stems directly from a massive growth in debt, with the total public and private lending soaring to over 250 per cent of economic output.\n“This expansion is increasingly viewed as problematic: the rapid pace of growth in bank assets has probably meant a lot of misallocation of resources and the creation of non-performing loans,” Chen said.\n\nThe new PBOC chief should avoid “miscommunication and errors” that could unintentionally scare or unnerve the financial markets, locally or globally, he added.\n“Zhou himself found it difficult to balance the secretive nature of Chinese political decision-making with the demands of global financial markets, and this tension will only intensify for his successor,” Chen wrote in a report issued on Tuesday.\nAccording to a statement from the State Council, the Tuesday consolidation of the watchdogs will improve the current regulatory system which “was not clear on the division of responsibility” and help to “prevent any systematic financial risk”.\nThere is no mention yet of any concrete changes to the current stock market regulator, the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC).\n“Banks and insurers have expanded their shadow banking business over the past few years amid the liberalisation of China’s financial market, making their capital ratio compliance ambiguous,” said Commerzbank’s Zhou. “A coordinated regulatory [regime] will help rein that back.”\n\nChina has been studying the application of several regulatory models overseas, Zhou said at a press conference last week. The governor, a scholar of world economic history, has a penchant for delivering off-the-cuff treatises on comparative regulations, either in Chinese or English.\nHe mentioned the “twin peaks model” of financial regulation adopted by the UK after the global financial crisis in 2008, that saw the Financial Services Authority (FSA) cease to exist, and its work split between two new regulatory authorities.\nChina is likely to “observe for a bit longer” before deciding the structure to adopt, emphasising the PBOC will play a bigger role in the regulatory regime in future, Zhou said.\nYou are signed up.

It saves on human resources and maintains a standardisation of services.”\nThe Hong Kong and Shenzhen-listed group’s founder and former chairman Wang Shi in 2015 said that 30 per cent of its property management services – from sweeping floors to guarding its estates – would be done by robots over the next 10 years.\nThe property developer, China’s second-largest with sales of 530 billion yuan (US$82.3 billion), believes in “3 Good” – good houses, good services and a good neighbourhood for its customers.\nTowards this end the company’s Vanke Building Research Centre in Dongguan, in south-eastern Guangdong province, conducts research on environmentally friendly building materials, development and application of precast concrete modules and stormwater management demonstration systems. It even has a botanical garden which has more than 800 different plant species.\nIn October 2017, Vanke opened its second R&D centre in Xiongan New Area focused on building technology innovation.\nChina Vanke, which is a recent entrant to the Hong Kong property development market, this year plans to debut its 100 per cent owned residential projects in the city where private new flats are highly concentrated in the hands of two giants – Sun Hung Kai Properties and CK Asset Holdings.\nThe company won the So Kwun Wat residential plot in Tuen Mun for HK$3.8 billion in a 2015 Hong Kong government tender after beating nine competitors.\nTo differentiate its products from its rivals and put an emphasis on healthy living, Chow said the group will include a one-kilometre (0.62-mile) long outdoor running track at its 1,000-unit residential project in Tuen Mun.\n\nThis also reflects the interest of chairman Yu Liang, who is an avid marathon runner. A kindergarten will be opened here to increase its appeal to potential buyers, he added.\n“Our projects will have other breakthrough concepts when we launch later.”\nIt also has two projects in the pipeline – a luxury serviced apartment building in Wan Chai comprising 105 units and a 500-unit residential development in Cheung Sha Wan.\nVanke’s joint venture project with New World Development and MTR – The Pavilia Bay in Tsuen Wan – launched has been a hit with buyers. The 980-unit project, launched in January last year, is nearly sold out and has pulled in about HK$7.8 billion in sales.\n“As a new entrant in Hong Kong, we have to learn from local developers,” Chow said, referring to the joint venture.\n\nThe company, which is based in the Bank of China Tower, in Central, employs about 60 people in Hong Kong, most of whom are from the city, which Chow said resembles the localisation practice in Vanke offices across the globe from London to New York.\nChina Vanke is involved in 30 overseas projects in cities such as New York, San Francisco, the UK, Singapore and Hong Kong.\nYou are signed up.

But others said the comments, which were made during a town hall event, were taken out of context.\nThe exchange happened last Thursday when Trudeau was fielding questions from the audience in Edmonton, Alberta. The woman, who said she was with the World Mission Society Church of God, first thanked Trudeau, a self-proclaimed feminist, for filling his Cabinet seats with women and recognising the “ability and power that women actually possess.” She went on to talk about concepts such as “maternal love” and “God the Mother” and said the world needs more female leaders who possess such love.\nShe then proceeded to ask Trudeau to look into policies on volunteering for religious charitable organisations and pivoted back to “maternal love”, describing it as “the love that’s going to change the future of mankind.”\nTrudeau waved his hand to interrupt.\nCanada’s anthem to become gender neutral after senate approves lyric change\n“We’d like to say ‘peoplekind’, not necessarily ‘mankind,’ ” Trudeau said.\nMany in the audience cheered, including the woman, whose name is not known.\n“There you go, exactly. Yes, thank you,” she said.\nAn editorial by the conservative tabloid Toronto Sun described Trudeau’s response as a form of mansplaining. In a column published on the Daily Mail, Piers Morgan called Trudeau “the single most PC-friendly” prime minister, intent on winning the hearts of liberals. Fox & Friends even aired an entire segment on the exchange, with a guest slamming Trudeau as a “radical leftist propagandist.”\nBut Daniel Dale, Washington correspondent for the Toronto Star, said on Twitter that the “US-right-wing pile-on” regarding Trudeau’s comment was misleading. Trudeau’s critics, Dale said, failed to mention the woman and the audience’s positive reaction.\n“He was lightly ribbing a woman who was rambling about the power of women, ‘God the Mother,’ and how the world needs womanly love,” Dale tweeted.\nVICE political columnist Drew Brown mocked Trudeau’s critics Tuesday, saying the prime minister was “so woke his brain went supernova and exploded!”\n“Social justice really rots your brain,” Brown said. “They should put a trigger warning for idiocy on those town hall tickets!”\nHe also posted a full video of the nearly two-hour-long town hall, saying the 22-second clip circulating among conservative outlets didn’t show the full context of the exchange. “After watching the extra three minutes around the clip in question, it seems like this is less a snuff film of ‘common sense’ than it is the prime minister doing a reasonably good job of handling [an] intensely religious Christian-adjacent heretic,” Brown wrote. “The video clip is real, but it has been cut to play as a (funny and believable) lie.”\nTrudeau has made it his mission to put more women in prominent political and judicial posts. Half of the 74 judges his government has appointed over the past year are women. His Cabinet also has an equal number of men and women. In 2016, he announced that a Canadian woman will be the face of the country’s newest bank notes, which are expected in 2018.\nIn a speech in Davos, Switzerland, last month, Trudeau defended gender and social equality and invoked the movements that have taken shape in the United States.\n“MeToo, TimesUp, the Women’s March – these movements tell us that we need to have a critical discussion on women’s rights, equality and power dynamics of gender,” he said.\nLast week, Canada’s Senate passed a bill that would make the country’s national anthem gender-neutral by changing the phrase “in all they sons command” to “in all of us command.”\nYou are signed up.

Paal says Beijing is softening its diplomatic approach to head off the possibility of an anti-China coalition forming on its doorstep, even as America’s influence and interest in the region wanes\nComments:\n\nChina will welcome South Korea’s president, Moon Jae-in, to Beijing this week in what could be a significant warming of a frosty relationship since Moon’s predecessor agreed in 2016 to deploy American missile defences. This visit will be analysed in terms of what it says about Seoul’s ability to manoeuvre between the competing ambitions of China and the United States and to manage the rising nuclear threat from North Korea. But we will do well to broaden our gaze beyond the already tense strategic competition over the Korean peninsula and examine how this visit fits into China’s overall foreign policy.\nFirst, the trip to Beijing is a real test for Moon. His impeached predecessor, Park Guen-hye, had bet heavily on her relationship with China’s leader, Xi Jinping, to manage the threat from North Korea, only to be embarrassed when Xi refused to take her phone calls after an important North Korean nuclear test. When Park decided to accept the American offer to bolster missile defences with deployment of a THAAD anti-missile system, Beijing construed the development as affecting its security and launched an unannounced but effective boycott of South Korean trade and tourism. To pour salt into the wound, Seoul desperately needs to hold a successful Winter Olympics in February, and China’s acquiescence is key to filling the seats.\n\nFor its part, the US has added to Moon’s discomfort by simultaneously pressing the left-leaning leader to accommodate Washington’s decidedly more bellicose reaction to the North’s nuclear and missile development while demanding the renegotiation of the Korea-US free trade agreement, which had already been negotiated twice before with the Bush and Obama administrations. To use a Korean metaphor, Moon is a shrimp among whales, and a happy ending is difficult to predict.\nChina’s Xi, by contrast, is in a stronger position, newly emerged from his coronation at the 19th Communist Party congress, presiding over a strong economy with new global ambitions and a reforming and strengthening military. Xi has managed a reasonably warm relationship with President Donald Trump, despite numerous economic and strategic tensions, and frozen out North Korea’s Kim Jong-un, while agreeing to unprecedented sanctions against his regime.\nSo how does this all fit into China’s broader vision? Earlier this year, a number of my Chinese contacts urged me to watch China’s foreign policy in the aftermath of the 19th party congress. They argued that Xi would launch a charm offensive around China’s periphery.\nXi has tried this before. In 2013, a year after taking the leadership, he summoned the country’s top diplomats for a conference on China’s foreign policy towards its periphery. It was purportedly to correct the mistakes in China’s foreign policy behaviour after 2008. From the time of the Asian financial crisis in 1997 to the Beijing Olympics in 2008, Chinese foreign policy appeared increasingly benign and beneficial to its neighbours. Diplomats were skilful and the economic opportunity was burgeoning.\nBut with the Olympics and concurrent global financial crisis, hubris seemed to consume many in China. The US was widely viewed as in decline.\nBeijing behaved haughtily. Arguments erupted in virtually all directions around China: with Japan over islands in the East China Sea, with Vietnam in the South China Sea, with India on their disputed border, with Myanmar over corrupt Chinese investment, and so on.\nThe October 2013 work conference was intended to refocus Chinese diplomacy and resources on improving China’s relationships with its neighbours. The objective was realistic, in the sense that China knew it would not turn its neighbours into allies. Rather, the goal was to deny the US, Japan, and possibly India, the capacity to forge a coalition with China’s neighbours to counterbalance growing Chinese power and influence. By offering trade and infrastructure (the “Belt and Road Initiative”) and restraining conflicts, Beijing could pre-empt any such effort.\nXi’s early ambitions fell apart. The belt and road failed to materialise beyond being a slogan. Xi oversaw the declaration of an unanticipated and unwelcome air defence identification zone over the East China Sea. He waged hybrid warfare in the South China Sea, laying claim to a vast area of the sea within a nine-dash line, but that claim was declared illegal by the Permanent Court of Arbitration in the Hague.\nNow, it appears Xi wants to start his charm offensive again. The strategic goal of preventing a coalition of anti-China neighbours remains unchanged. His motivation has probably been enhanced by Barack Obama’s “pivot to Asia”, now largely judged to have been an unsuccessful challenge to China’s rise, and by Trump’s new “Indo-Pacific strategy”, which is clearly intended to compete with China, though it remains mostly unarticulated. The Trump administration’s national security strategy is expected to be unveiled in the coming days.\nThe early evidence for this Chinese charm offensive is rather compelling. Within days of the completion of the 19th party congress, Beijing announced a new agreement and mechanism with Hanoi to manage their disputes in the South China Sea.\n\nAgreement was also reached between the Chinese and South Korean foreign ministers to limit THAAD deployments in exchange for normalising relations. Meanwhile, Tokyo and Beijing also revealed intentions for Xi to make a state visit next year to Japan, and agreed to a long-delayed mechanism to manage tensions in the East China Sea.\nIn Southeast Asia, China continues to woo Rodrigo Duterte’s government in the Philippines while Myanmar’s military and civilian leaders recently made back-to-back visits to China.\nLastly, the belt and road is being jolted into action on many fronts. Rhetorically, Xi is seizing the opportunity presented by Trump to champion the international system.\nThe US has not been completely idle. The Trump administration recognised early on that Obama’s strategy towards Southeast Asia had let smaller obstacles interfere with larger objectives in Thailand, Malaysia and the Philippines. White House efforts to re-engage these nations’ leaders with presidential meetings appear deeply appreciated, if as yet unsubstantial. But the US remains hamstrung with its rejection of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, unfilled policy positions, populist disdain for the international order and failure to escape deep and costly entanglement in the Middle East.\nBeing the self-referential behemoth that it is, China could fail again with the latest charm offensive. The issues that have infected China’s relations with its neighbours for decades will not disappear. It will behove observers to watch how China manages those issues and disputes, as well as how Washington, Tokyo, and perhaps New Delhi provide leadership and resources to counter or exploit Beijing’s blandishments.\nDouglas H.

Trump has said he didn’t use such language, while others present say he did.\nMany in Africa were taken aback by the comments after nearly a year of little attention to Africa by the Trump administration.\nOn Friday, Trump met with Rwanda’s president and new African Union chair Paul Kagame at the World Economic Forum, calling Kagame a “friend.”\n\nThe 55-nation continental body’s summit is expected to respond to Trump’s apparently vulgar remark. An AU spokeswoman has said the organisation was “frankly alarmed” by the reported comment and a number of African nations have spoken out or summoned US diplomats to explain.\nTrump’s letter says the US “profoundly respects” the partnerships and values shared by the US and Africans and that the president’s commitment to strong relationships with African nations is “firm”.\nThe letter offers Trump’s “deepest compliments” to the African leaders as they gather. It notes that US soldiers are “fighting side by side” against extremism on the continent and that the US is working to increase “free, fair and reciprocal trade” with African countries and partnering to “safeguard legal immigration”.\nThe letter does not include details about Tillerson’s upcoming visit.\nYou are signed up.

Basically that means 800 million payments per hour.\n\"Visa has a maximum capacity of processing 25,000 payments per second. But Alipay can process 50,000 payments, twice as much, per second.\"\nThe rise of online payments through non-bank services, exemplified by Alipay and WeChat Pay – which falls under the Tenpay umbrella – in China, has caused another banking giant, Goldman Sachs, to stand up and take notice too.\nThe firm recently published a report, led by Mancy Sun, which reveals the value of third-party payments in China grew more than 74 times from 2010 to 2016, from US$155 billion to a staggering US$11.4 trillion.\nOf that total, 56 per cent took the form of peer-to-peer transfers while about 16 per cent was consumption-related. Furthermore, payments made via third-party payment companies comprised 40 per cent of all retail sales, a figure that is still growing.\nThe user base in China of these applications is also mind-boggling. Goldman Sachs' report showed that there were 3.4 billion third-party payment accounts in China last year.\nAs of December, Tenpay managed around 600 million payment accounts. By March this year, Alipay had reached 520 million payment accounts. Both numbers dwarf the 197 million users Paypal has globally.\nMore from the South China Morning Post:\nMost Android stock trading apps in Hong Kong are rife with security risks, study shows\nFacebook bought an AI startup that could turn its middling virtual assistant into a Siri killer\nSichuan earthquake stirs up painful memories of 2008 disaster\nThe emergence of new electronic payment methods is undoubtedly reshaping consumer behaviour.\nLi Yong, 23, a resident of Guangzhou, Guangdong, rarely carries cash with her nowadays. When it comes to commuting, she said major metro stations all feature machines which allow riders to top up their metrocards or purchase tickets with either Alipay or Tenpay. Or she can make use of dockless shared bikes if she does not want to take the metro.\n\"I only carry my wallet when I have to board a plane or a train because I need to show my IDs on those occasions,\" she said.\nLi believes mobile online payment now accounts for the majority of urbanites' daily expenses, more than spending with credit cards and cash combined.\n\"There are QR codes for Alipay or Tenpay for expenses as small as one-yuan soymilk or a five-yuan chow-fun in a street-side breakfast place,\" she said. \"You can find QR codes at snack stands, street vendors or places like H&M.\"\nThe growth rate of the online payment sector is showing no signs of abating. According to Chinese central bank data, online payments through non-bank services expanded 60 per cent in the first quarter to 47 billion transactions valued at 26.47 trillion yuan (US$3.9 trillion), 43 per cent more than last year.\nAnd it's not just online payments where the traditional banks are being left behind. They're also losing ground to mobile trading platforms.\nThe second quarter of this year was a tough one for the trading desks of big Wall Street banks.\nGoldman Sachs' trading revenue fell 17 per cent, while at Citigroup, it was down 7 per cent. JPMorgan's revenue fell somewhere in between, declining 14 per cent to US$4.8 billion.\n\"The retail banking market has gone through big changes in the way people interact with machines and computers, but the wholesale market has not,\" said David Hudson, JPMorgan's global head of markets execution.\nHe said traditional banks had failed to ride the first wave when mobile banking started to gain traction.\n\"Wholesale banking has probably missed the ways consumer banking has gone through the year,\" he said, \"My two-year-old can use an iPhone. But it's quite difficult to use complex products from banks.\"\nUlrich said it is imperative for traditional banks to start evolving.\n\"In the next three to five years, the line between traditional banks and fintech companies will become blurred. Traditional banks have to, in some ways, become fintech companies themselves.\n\"Otherwise we will be left with no business.\"\n\n\nPlaying\nShare this video...\nWatch Next...\n"}

The region in question includes one of the world's most important shipping lanes, believed to be rich in mineral and marine resources.\nBut as expectations for an area code of conduct differ between Beijing and the Asean nations, the road to reaching agreement on a set of principles and expectations could be bumpy, observers say.\nFor Beijing, a code of conduct could be a non-binding instrument that can be leveraged to improve regional trust, rather than resolve overlapping claims; Asean members, however, may have a different opinion, said Zhang Mingliang, a Southeast Asia expert at Jinan University in Guangzhou.\nThe draft framework of the code of conduct was made final at an Asean and China senior officials meeting in May in southwestern China's Guizhou province.\nDetails about the framework's content have not been released to the public since. The Chinese foreign ministry has said this non-action could keep outside interference away. It did not name the US, whose Asia Pacific policy has remained partially fuzzy since US President Donald Trump took power in January, triggering widespread concern among Southeast Asian nations.\nMore from the South China Morning Post:\nChina and Asean agree to draft code of conduct in South China Sea\nIs Philippines offering Beijing an olive branch over South China Sea? China's tough stance on India causing concern in Southeast Asia\nIn May, Singaporean Foreign Minister Chee Wee Kiong said the draft framework had \"positive momentum\" and that he hoped to make \"steady progress toward a substantive code of conduct\".\nA draft of the text leaked by the media describes the envisioned agreement as \"a set of norms to guide the conduct of parties and promote maritime cooperation in the South China Sea\". It is \"not an instrument to settle territorial disputes.\"\nRegional experts and diplomats believe the agreement's framework will be more symbolic in content than substantive.\n\"Many principles, such as peaceful solving disputes, have been approved by different parties even without the framework,\" said Zhang Mingliang of Jinan University.\nRobespierre Bolivar, a spokesman for the Department of Foreign Affairs of the Philippines, told reporters in Manila on Tuesday that the framework would be an outline. He did not specifically mention the arbitration decision in which The Hague's Permanent Court ruled against China's territorial claims and its massive reclamation activities in the region.\nThe concept of a code of conduct was first raised in the 1990s; but it was not until 2002 at a gathering of foreign ministers from Asean countries and China in Phnom Penh, Cambodia, that a code of conduct was mandated by the non-binding China-Asean Declaration on Conduct of the Parties in the South China Sea.\nSince then, little progress on a code of conduct has been made while tensions have intensified as reports of fishing disputes in the area grow commonplace.\nIt was not until 2013, when Beijing, in an apparent attempt to ease its tensions with its Southeast Asian neighbours, agreed to begin formal consultation on the code of conduct.\nAnd it took almost four years for senior officials from China and the Asean nations to agree on a framework for the code of conduct, though the framework's contents remain unreleased to the public.\nAs the host of this year's Asean summit and as a key claimant state in the South China Sea territorial disputes, the Philippines has said it will push for starting discussions on the actual code of conduct as soon as the Framework-COC is officially endorsed on Sunday.\nHowever, prospects for the parties reaching agreement on a real code of conduct remain dim.\nFor Asean, the challenge will be getting all 10 members to come to a unified viewpoint on the South China Sea issue; meanwhile, Beijing, which has been growing more assertive on maritime issues, is unlikely to step back over its sovereignty, which it calls a core national interest.\nIn an interview with ABS-CBN News, Medardo Abad Jr., the former chief of the Asean Regional Forum, said that obtaining a commitment from the stakeholders not to militarise the disputed area should be included in the framework.\nFinally, signs of renewed tensions in the South China Sea have reemerged in recent months.\nVietnam, also a member of Asean, has been oil drilling in disputed waters claimed by China since June, and China has built a cinema on Woody Island in the Paracels, which are also claimed by Taiwan and Vietnam.\n\nPlaying\nShare this video...\nWatch Next...\n"}

{"title": "Rampaging 'Gray Rhinos' pose threat to China's economy", "author": "Asia Times", "pub_time": "2018年3月9日", "url": "http://www.atimes.com/article/rampaging-gray-rhinos-pose-threat-chinas-economy/", "content": "They are bruising beasts of the corporate jungle and they have spooked Beijing’s economic wise men. Known as “Gray Rhinos,” these sprawling conglomerates are considered rogue “creatures” that tend to charge at any moment, wreaking financial havoc.\nAs metaphors go, this is an apt description of the Anbang Insurance Group, a major player in the world’s second-largest economy, but just another ambitious Chinese company on the global stage.\nLast month, all that changed with the government’s unprecedented takeover of the Beijing-based behemoth after it was barred from selling complex and high-risk wealth management products disguised as insurance policies.\n“The move had huge significance,” Hu Xingdou, an economist at the Beijing Institute of Technology, told the media. “If something went wrong with Anbang it would lead to massive bad loans in the financial system.”\nDuring the past three years, the group has gone on a whirlwind, worldwide spending spree after gorging on cheap credit. In 2015, it bought the legendary Waldorf Astoria in New York for nearly US$2 billion and later made a $6.5 billion move for Strategic Hotels and Resorts.\nIn South Korea, it snapped up Tongyang Life Insurance for $1 billion and Allianz Korea before buying the Dutch insurance firm Vivat and Fidea Insurance in Belgium.\nTwo years ago, Anbang also acquired Retirement Concepts, the largest retirement home chain in the Canadian province of British Columbia.\nWith 1.97 trillion yuan ($310.85 billion) in assets, the company was ranked 139 in the 2017 Global 500 list, compiled by Fortune magazine.\n“Insurance money is ordinary people’s pensions and life insurance. It must be invested in the best companies,” the flamboyant founder of the group, Wu Xiaohui, told a business conference back in 2016. “We must protect small investors.”\nAfter working in the retail car business, the 51-year-old launched Anbang in 2004. Thirteen years later, it had 3,000 branches with 30,000 employees dotted around the world, serving 35 million clients.\nAt the core of the company was life insurance, banking, asset management, leasing and brokerage services.\nPredictably, Wu was compared to the iconic American investor Warren Buffett for his savvy business sense in China’s state-run media. There were also suggestions he had strong political connections through his wife Zhuo Ran, a granddaughter of former Paramount Leader Deng Xiaoping.\nBut even those high-level contacts failed to save him last June when he was detained by authorities and charged with “economic crimes” after the Chinese authorities decided to crack down on the financial industry to guard against excessive borrowing.\nOn Feb. 23, the government’s English-language mouthpiece, Global Times, reported that the insurance regulator had moved in to run Anbang “for a year” to “protect consumers’ rights.”\n“Illegal business practices by Anbang Insurance Group may seriously threaten the solvency of the company,” the China Insurance Regulatory Commission revealed in a statement without disclosing further details.\nWhat is definitely not in doubt is Beijing’s aggressive stance in clamping down on ballooning debt in the private sector.\nThis has been a recurring theme in interviews with Zhou Xiaochuan, the respected governor of the People’s Bank of China or central bank. He has repeatedly warned that reducing corporate debt will be crucial to preventing a “future financial crisis.”\nTurning the Anbang affair into a high-profile case also acted as an opening shot to other private and publicly-listed companies to curb spiraling spending fueled by short-term loans.\n“Anbang was probably taken out in a really public manner to set an example for others to step back a little bit,” Adams Lee, an international trade lawyer at Harris Bricken, told CNBC.\nThe “others” could include HNA – which was described by Fortune magazine as the “biggest company you have never heard of” – Dalian Wanda, run by the charismatic Wang Jianlin, and Fosun International.\nThere is certainly no evidence to suggest that they face serious financial difficulties. But they have pursued aggressive acquisition policies and amber lights have started to flash.\nHNA, for example, has invested an estimated $40 billion since 2015 and now owns China’s Hainan Airlines, airport services company Swissport and airline caterer Gategroup.\nIt also holds a major stake in Deutsche Bank and 25% of the Hilton Hotel Group. Carlson Hotels, which runs the Radisson chain, was another major purchase.\nOn paper these are all solid companies with shiny brand names, while HNA had assets hovering around the $80 billion mark, the Financial Times reported in 2016. But rebalancing the books has now become a priority with the group aiming to sell up to $6 billion in property holdings around the world.\n“If HNA simply cannot meet its financial obligations, we expect regulators to broker a debt restructuring,” Michael Hirson, the Asia director of the consultancy Eurasia Group, said. “The removal of senior management will likely be a condition of any explicit or implicit bailout.”\nAs for Wanda, the company has already started offloading assets after expanding in the United States by acquiring the cinema group AMC Entertainment for about $2.6 billion in 2012 and Legendary Entertainment, the studio behind Jurassic World and Interstellar, for $3.5 billion in February 2017.\nLast summer, Chinese regulators reportedly told banks to stop providing funding for several of the entertainment empire’s overseas ventures as part of a broader Beijing campaign to rein in “irrational spending” by major conglomerates.\nShortly after, the group sold a portfolio of domestic hotels and tourist attractions, including 13 theme parks, for $9 billion to R&F Guangzhou Properties and Sunac China, even though its assets exceeded 700 billion yuan ($110 billion).\nEarlier this week, it also announced it would sell a 13% stake, worth about $1.2 billion, in listed subsidiary Wanda Film Holdings to e-commerce giant Alibaba and state-owned Cultural Investment Holdings.\n“The main purpose of the equity transfer is to bring in shareholders with strategic value,” the company said in a statement, as the curtain was finally brought down on its overseas adventure.\nFosun’s story is remarkably similar. Between 2010 and 2015, the investment company spent nearly $15 billion, Bloomberg reported, on recognized brand names such as France’s Club Med, Britain’s Thomas Cook Group and Canada’s Cirque du Soleil.\nOther major acquisitions, included the American clothing label St John and Greek jeweler Folli Follie. Then, at the end of last year, it started trimming its real estate division to reflect the changing economic climate, despite having assets of more than 500 billion yuan.\nA 95% stake in its Sydney office tower block was sold to Australian property investment firm Propertylink Group and the Swiss investment manager Partners Group for A$142.5 million ($109 million).\nStill, Fosun and Wanda appear to be on “more solid” financial ground.\n“Wanda has also benefited from chairman Wang’s aggressive moves to sell assets and ‘de-risk’ in the middle of last year, a painful decision but one that now looks very astute,” Hirson said.\nEven though one “Gray Rhino” has already been bagged in Anbang, it remains to be seen if there is a herd of rogue companies rumbling around in China’s corporate undergrowth.\nRead: Wang seems to have lost his Wanda-lust\n"}
{"title": "Justin Trudeau Says 2015's Sunny Promises Will Take Canada ...", "author": "HuffPost Canada", "pub_time": "2018年1月16日", "url": "https://www.huffingtonpost.ca/2018/01/16/justin-trudeau-says-2015s-sunny-promises-will-take-canada-through-2018s-storms_a_23335252/", "content": "OTTAWA — Justin Trudeau sees dark clouds on the political horizon: severe weather and income inequality begetting forced migration and a growing strain to feed the dispossessed, as well as the ever-present threats of terrorism and nuclear annihilation.\nBut halfway through his mandate, the prime minister remains steadfastly confident that the agenda that won him power in 2015 — his \"progressive approach\" to global affairs, income disparity, globalization angst and populism — will be enough to carry Canadians to a brighter future.\nPoliticians, says Trudeau, have two options. They can exploit that public angst for political gain, or do what he says his government has done: give tangible benefits to working people, while taxing the wealthy and making them remember the people who work for them.\nPoliticians can amplify or allay anxiety, PM says\n\"That's the choice to be made,\" Trudeau said this week in an interview with The Canadian Press.\n\"When people are anxious, are you amplifying that anxiety or are you allaying that anxiety with reasonable policy choices that are showing there is a reason for confidence in one's kids future. That's very much the latter path we chose to take in the 2015 election and I continue to choose.\"\nCanada, Trudeau said, is \"bucking the trend in terms of globalization as a source of anxiety for citizens\" by being \"absolutely unequivocal\" that global trade has to benefit everyone, not just the rich and powerful.\nAnd while he's honed his wording, sharpened his digs at the opposition and beefed up his economic arguments since the 2015 campaign, he said the policies he laid out during that marathon election remain relevant and active, even as he braces for the stormy ride he knows is coming from his opponents at home.\nJustin Tang/Canadian Press\nPrime minister-elect Justin Trudeau shakes hands as he leaves following his victory speech at Liberal party headquarters in Montreal on Oct. 19, 2015 after winning the 42nd Canadian general election.\nCase in point: Trudeau is girding for more questions about his controversial vacation on the billionaire Aga Khan's private island, an adventure that earned him a rebuke from the ethics commissioner — a first for a Canadian prime minister.\n\"I am expecting there might be a few more questions once Parliament returns on this ... exact issue,\" he said.\nThe controversy has given the opposition a powerful counterpoint to the preferred Liberal narrative, painting Trudeau as an elite child of privilege, divorced from the reality of the middle class he purports to champion.\nNot so, the prime minister insists, saying he's not above telling the rich and powerful they need to do better by the working people on whose backs they built their fortunes.\nIt's a message he says he first delivered in Germany to a ritzy gathering of European business elite in Hamburg last winter. And he says that's why he ad-libbed an ominous, dark ending to a speech to a tony Fortune 500 audience in China last month.\nTrudeau said he took the measure of the room and decided it needed a special message.\n\n\n\"You need to know that if you want to continue to succeed and want to continue to see a global environment that will allow you to succeed in business, you have to do a better job of thinking of the impact on ordinary people and families,\" he said.\nNext week, Trudeau is taking that message to Davos, Switzerland, where he will attend the World Economic Forum.\nA year ago, Trudeau skipped the annual gathering of political and economic elite as fallout from his Aga Khan trip discouraged him from wanting to publicly rub elbows with even more rich business people and celebrities.\nThe trip, he said this week, will give him one more opportunity to trumpet his progressive approach.\n\"We have the strongest economic growth of the G7. We have the lowest unemployment rate in Canada since before the Montreal Olympics [in 1976]. So, we have a concrete story to tell.\"\nTrudeau's message will be heard by one key guest — U.S. President Donald Trump, whose anti-trade policies don't dovetail with those of the prime minister.\nTrudeau continues to insist that it's not his job to preach to Trump, as other leaders such as French President Emmanuel Macron have done. He reiterates that he must find common ground with Trump on creating jobs and achieving a successful outcome to the North American Free Trade Agreement renegotiation.\nJIM WATSON/AFP via Getty Images\nU.S. President Donald Trump listens to Prime Minister Justin Trudeau as they walk towards the Oval Office of the White House in Washington, D.C., on Oct. 11, 2017.\n\"We know that he is committed to improving the plight of American workers who may feel that for many years there has been less benefit for them in globalization, in international trade, which is no different from what I said in the 2015 election.\"\nBut Trudeau is also cognizant that the outside threats to his message are omnipresent, including by those who seek to use violence to instill fear and terror about an open, tolerant world and the ongoing nuclear crisis on the Korean peninsula.\nHe also says climate change can unleash security threats that can touch Canada as well — a topic that's been thoroughly explored in military doctrine published by the Pentagon and Britain's military over the past decade.\n\"On climate change the greatest threat facing Canada is continued behaviour as usual,\" he said, adding it is imperative for Canada to reduce pollution and develop new sources of clean energy.\n\"Or else we know the world is going to be rapidly more and more extreme weather events that are going to cause displacement of millions upon millions of people around the world, and put an undue strain on our capacity to support all the mouths that there are to feed.\"\nAlso On HuffPost:\nWhen Trudeau Met Trump\nWhen Trudeau Met Trump\n1\nof\n49\nShare this slide:\nShare this slide:\nGet top stories and blog posts emailed to me each day.

{"title": "Capitalism's first three phases served the rich: will Industry 4.0 do ...", "author": "South China Morning Post", "pub_time": "2017年10月26日", "url": "http://www.scmp.com/comment/insight-opinion/article/2117260/capitalisms-first-three-phases-served-rich-will-industry-40", "content": "\nGlobal Financial Crisis\nAndrew Sheng says the new wave of industrial innovation may use more advanced technology than the digital revolution, but it needs a new development model to avoid falling into the same traps\nComments:\n\nAs we go through the fog of modernity, confused by threats of war, toxic politics, terrorism, tech-led job disruption, and natural and human disasters, what is the right development model going forward?\nIn the post-war period, development was defined by the Bretton Woods multilateral institutions framework, comprising the International Monetary Fund, World Bank and World Trade Organisation. As long as developing countries played by global rules, opening to free trade and following orthodox fiscal and monetary discipline, they could join the global market and enjoy growth.\n\nThis creed was severely tested by the Asian Financial Crisis of 1997. Asian economies open to trade and investment suddenly faced a crisis due to sharp capital withdrawals, accompanied by speculative attacks causing devaluations, bank failures and recession. It was not helped by initially wrong policy prescriptions by the IMF, whose orthodox call for tighter fiscal discipline and higher interest rates exacerbated the downturn.\nIf the period of mercantilism before the Industrial Revolution in the 18th century can be called Capitalism 1.0, and the Industrial Revolution, Capitalism 2.0, the phase from the late 19th century to 2007 can be called Capitalism 3.0. This was the period when the West pushed globalisation, first led by the British Empire (version 3.1) and then the US after the second world war (version 3.2).\n\nCapitalism 3.3 truly achieved globalisation through the rapid spread of markets, made obvious by China joining the WTO in 2001, creating new heights in global trade and investment. The global supply chain, of which there are two obvious wings，– between Europe and the US, and between East Asia and US/Europe – but with raw materials and components sourced from everywhere, was essentially created through technological improvements in shipping, air and land transport, telecommunications and, since 1991, the internet.\nThe arrival of the internet accelerated the networking of trade and investment and, more importantly, finance and digital data. Since friction costs (or transaction costs) are higher for physical goods than virtual goods, finance and knowledge spread faster through technological improvements.\n\nBy 2007, Capitalism 3.3 appeared unassailable. The accepted development model for all emerging markets was to plug into the global supply chain, comply with WTO rules and Bretton Woods advice. Failure to do so could be attributed to policy mistakes or bad execution, through either incompetence, bad governance or corruption.\nThe global financial crisis of 2007-2009 shattered confidence in Capitalism 3.0, because it revealed massive inequities and an inability to deal with rising climate change, fundamentalism in the guise of populism and clear inadequacies in mainstream economic theory to deal with such crises.\n\nThose in the tech revolution are already mapping out Industry 4.0. The Davos World Economic Forum associated Industry 1.0 with the steam age, the second with the electrical age, the third, the digital revolution and the fourth to the new internet of industry. Today, technological breakthroughs in robotics, nanotechnology, biotechnology and artificial intelligence create new goods and services, requiring new governance.\nThe problem with Industry 4.0 is whether emerging markets can cope with the speed, scale and scope of technological change, on top of rising natural disasters, urban congestion, pollution and other problems. Industry 4.0 seems to be creating a new age of even more dominance by giants.\n\nCapitalism 3.0 became capital-friendly and a disaster for labour because, instead of bringing prosperity for all, it brought a better life for the 1 per cent. Populism arose because even the middle class in advanced countries realised capitalism did not benefit all. If rich countries with the resources to deal with both technological disruption and natural disasters have trouble coping with Capitalism 4.0, what is the new model for emerging markets?\nI wonder if Adam Smith would turn in his grave if he realised that free market ideologues used his ideas in The Wealth of Nations to allow a small elite to get rich at others’ expense. Omitting “political” from “political economy”, neo-classical free market ideologues promoted positive economics and pushed the idea of “rational man”, assuming away important parts of human behaviour like politics, psychology, sociology and anthropology.

Scorpions scamper in bowls, water snakes coil in tanks and cats whine in cramped cages, waiting to be slaughtered, skinned and served for dinner. Welcome to the Qingping market, where everything from turtles to insects are sold alongside fowl and freshly caught fish. REUTERS/Joseph Chaney\nWelcome to the Qingping market in the southern Chinese city of Guangzhou, where everything from turtles to insects are sold alongside fowl and freshly caught fish.\nAn outbreak of the SARS virus in 2002 resulted in a local gourmet favorite — the civet — being banished to the black market. The raccoon-like animal was blamed for spreading SARS, which infected 8,000 people globally and killed 800.\nBut exotic wildlife and squalor have returned to the Qingping market, making health officials worried that another killer virus could emerge.\n“We face similar threats from other viruses and such epidemics can happen because we continue to have very crowded markets in China,” said Lo Wing-lok, an infectious disease expert in Hong Kong.\n“Even though official measures are in place, they are not faithfully followed. We are not talking about just civet cats, but all animals,” he added.\nEver since Severe Respiratory Disease Syndrome (SARS) virus emerged in China, authorities have fought to rectify the country’s image and clean up it’s market.\nCivets, which are a delicacy in southern China, are now banned for sale and consumption, and a nine-storey traditional medicine plaza has replaced Qingping’s wild animal market.\n“The market is much different now,” said He Zhiquan, an official from Guangdong’s foreign affairs office.\n“Civet cats are forbidden, and sanitation is an important issue. Most live animals are sold on the city’s outskirts. You can see it’s more of a normal market now.”\nPropaganda posters such as “Everyone should honor the policy of paying attention to product safety”, hang everywhere at Qingping.\nStill, sights abound that would send even the most ardent carnivores running.\nIn a dark shop near the new medicine mall, feces and urine drip like goo through stacked cages of squawking chickens and meowing cats.\n“The Qingping market is dirty,” said a Guangzhou-born taxi driver, surnamed Mo. “It’s dirty because it’s old, and the government is unwilling to put up enough money to fix it.”\nIn wealthy Guangzhou, rising incomes and fear of diseases are sending well-heeled consumers to supermarkets in search of packaged and branded goods.\nYet outside of China’s glitzy marquee cities of Shanghai, Beijing, and Guangzhou, traditional wet markets still account for the bulk of fresh food sales in China.\n“The concept of buying food once a week and putting it in your fridge doesn’t really exist in China yet. It’s produced today, bought today, and eaten later today,” said John Chapple, general manager for China-based food analysis laboratory Sino Analytica.\nAnd dangerous tastes persist under the radar.\nAlthough Guangdong authorities culled thousands of civets in January 2004, investigators recently found the animals, as well as badgers and pangolins, on the black market and in Guangdong’s “wild flavor” restaurants, where diners hope exotic meats will bring good fortune.\nHealth inspectors found 14 frozen and one live civet cat, and 22 kilograms of civet cat meat from 18 animals in a sweep of restaurants across the province, the People’s Daily newspaper reported earlier this year.\n“You can’t say something else won’t come up,” said Li Jib-heng, general specialist at the Department of Health in Taiwan.\nThe odds of another human catching SARS from a sick civet cat were next to none, Li said, but added a new disease could emerge from close contact with sick wild animals.\nKeeping clear of wild animals could prove difficult for some locals, who are known for their eclectic palettes.\nAmong Qingping’s cats and chickens were tiger paws, turtles, insects of myriad varieties, and bundled strips of shredded toads — some food, others medicine.\n“You can eat anything with four legs except the dinner table,” says one local expression.\n(Additional reporting by Ralph Jennings and Ee Lyn Tan)\nEditing by Megan Goldin\nAll quotes delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.

Contrary to widespread belief, China isn't the cheap place to manufacture that it once was, and rising costs have been forcing manufacturers to explore new countries to make their goods.\nThe U.S. may not be top of mind for all industries, but some manufacturers are taking a second look at the country — and many of them are Chinese. Throw in the possibility of lower corporate taxes under President Donald Trump, and more will likely come looking.\n\"The reason we want to invest in the U.S. isn't only because the Trump administration is encouraging it,\" Xiao Wunan, deputy chairman of Asia Pacific Exchange and Cooperation Foundation, who takes Chinese business executives to the U.S. on investment tours, told CNBC. \"The U.S. has natural advantages for [Chinese] investment.\"\nThe cost advantage\nJohn Ling, president of the Council of American States in China, makes a living finding prospective investment locations in the U.S. for Chinese companies.\n\"In every project I help to land in the U.S., if I cannot present evidence that they can lower their costs, my chance of doing [the deal] in the U.S. is almost zero,\" he told CNBC. \"Cost is driving this.\"\nAmerican workers earn a lot of money compared to their counterparts in China, but the U.S. can still come out on top when costs are taken as a whole.\nFor Hangzhou-based textile manufacturer Keer Group, American workers were paid on average twice as much as workers in China, according to the firm's president, Zhu Shanqing. In aggregate, however, producing in the America is significantly less compared to China.\n\"In the U.S., land, electricity and cotton are all much cheaper,\" Zhu said. \"My production cost per ton of textiles is 25 percent lower [there].\"\nIn addition, he said, wages for him in China have been increasing 30 percent each year for much of the past decade. He has pledged $220 million to build and expand a facility in South Carolina and plans to eventually move the entire business to the U.S. where he plans to employ more than 500 people by the end of the year.\nAdd in the possibility of a lower corporate tax to as little as 15 percent, as proposed by Trump, and the U.S. becomes a no-brainer for many manufacturers Zhu said.\n\"If Trump cuts the corporate tax even by 5 percent, companies that left America a few years ago, will be back,\" he said.\nThe stable business environment\nCompared to many other countries, especially in the emerging world, China has been a stalwart of stability for manufacturers for decades. However, the U.S. does have some selling points that Chinese companies don't really like to talk about on record: better air, safer food, straightforward access to funding and a government that doesn't intervene.\nU.S. state politicians will pitch to a foreign company to bring in the jobs, but once they've invested, it's said the American officials leave them alone. Once a company is in the U.S., Chinese or not, it is treated like any other company.\nThe proximity to the U.S. consumer\n\nChinese consumers are the spenders of the future, but Americans are the buyers of today. As Chinese companies grow in stature and expand their footprint overseas, many of them see the U.S. market as the holy grail.\nGuangzhou-based GAC Motor, which is eyeing the U.S. market, says partnering with a stateside automaker or even building its own American plant one day is in the cards.\n\"If we can succeed in the U.S. market, we can succeed anywhere in the world,\" President Yu Jun told CNBC, adding that having facilities in the U.S. makes a manufacturer more nimble to respond to a customer's needs.\n\"No matter if it's a good economy or a bad economy, the U.S. is still the number one market for any company in the world,\" Ling explained. \"So certainly, naturally you want to be closer to where your customers are.\"\nCapital-intensive industries: Definitely.\nAll sorts of companies are interested in setting up shop in the U.S., according to Ling, but there is an emerging trend.\nThe most suited, he said, are capital-intensive industries such as textiles, chemicals, paper and packaging and auto parts. Chinese billionaire Cao Dewang, whose company Fuyao Glass makes window shields for cars, recently invested hundreds of millions of dollars to revive a plant in Ohio.\n\"I don't believe we have scratched the surface yet,\" Ling said.\nLabor-intensive industries: No thanks.\nLabor-intensive industries such as apparel are not as keen.\nChina-based Austrian garment manufacturer KTC, which sells sports clothing mainly to Europe and the U.S., says its industry still depends heavily on labor. American workers are still more expensive than Chinese and the other factors wouldn't bring costs down enough to make it worthwhile for a move, says Managing Director Gerhard Flatz.\nAdditionally, American workers don't have the skills right now that have been developed in China over years, he told CNBC.\nLing said some high-labor businesses, though, have been able to make the transition lowering costs since, unlike in China, manufacturers in the U.S. don't have to worry about building dormitories and canteens or arranging transportation for their workers. \"You only have a small canteen with a refrigerator and one or two microwaves,\" Ling said about the U.S.\nA skills shortage\nChina's status as a manufacturing powerhouse means it has gained decades of experienced talent — which has been drained out of the U.S.\n\"We face pressure in the U.S. because we cannot find skilled workers. Most of the people have not worked in this [field] before in their lives,\" Keer's Zhu said.\nKTC's Flatz sees a strong argument for investment in training and education for more China-based jobs to move to America. \"Education—tradesman education,\" he said. \"You have to make sure that you have enough educational power in the States, more or less, to bring up this entire industry.\"\nVisas\nTo help train American workers, some manufacturers in China want to bring in their own managers and skilled workforce, but are having trouble obtaining the proper paperwork.\n\"Our technicians cannot get visas to go to the U.S. We need [our staff], but many of them have been refused,\" Zhu said. \"We are facing a new challenge.\"\nSupply Chain\nIn addition to the lack of skilled workers, Flatz said entire supply chains would have to relocate to the U.S. for some industries.\n\"None of us apparel manufacturers would move to the U.S. without having an ecosystem on site as we have in China,\" he said.\nThe U.S. would have to do what the Chinese did decades ago, the China manufacturing veteran explained: set up economic zones, offer better infrastructure and financial incentives as a package.\n\"Make it the same as the Chinese,\" he said. \"And start on-shoring.\"\n—CNBC's Daisy Cherry contributed to this report.\n\nPlaying\nShare this video...\nWatch Next...\n"}

With the United States having withdrawn from the Paris climate change accord, China has been eyed to take a leadership role. It has been reluctant to take charge, but the scale of the scheme to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and the potential impact on international levels effectively put the nation in a central position. It is what the world needs at such a challenging time to stop temperatures from rising.\nChina has long been the world’s biggest polluter and unexpected economic growth this year has threatened to derail efforts to meet targets under the accord. The carbon trading market, which will be the world’s largest when it is launched in 2019, will dramatically reduce emissions and ensure it stays on track; more than 1,700 power plants, behind the generation of almost 40 per cent of the nation’s carbon dioxide pollution, will be included. In later stages, the chemical, building and aviation industries will be among sectors added. The strategy will go a considerable way to helping China meet its goal of capping emissions by 2030, although the success of efforts so far give cause for some experts to believe this could happen as soon as 2025.\nCan China switch 70 per cent of northern cities to clean heating by 2021 in bid to tackle pollution?\nMeeting and exceeding targets could help the world attain its Paris goals, even with the absence of the US. President Xi Jinping, who is behind the drive, well knows the benefits for growth and development, a reality refuted by his American counterpart, Donald Trump, who denies that air pollution is causing global warming. The creation of a clean energy industry has brought billions of dollars and thousands of jobs and China is now a world leader in numerous fields, including solar and wind. Such efforts will reduce air pollution, improve the health of citizens, strengthen the nation’s diplomacy and improve its image.\nXi used the term “torch-bearer” rather than “leader” at the Communist Party’s recent 19th congress when referring to China’s role in the fight against climate change. But the introduction of the carbon trading market gives cause to consider taking up the leadership.\nYou are signed up. We think you'd also like\n"}

The site now known as 5 World Trade Center remains vacant amid the redevelopment of lower Manhattan’s business district.\nWanda’s plans for New York included a five-star hotel, department store and condos (Rendering by Kohn Pedersen Fox via newyorkyimby.com)\nAlthough Wanda never closed on its planned acquisition of the New York site, the developer was confident enough of its prospects in the US at the time to commission a design for a 1,050 foot tower split between 240 hotel rooms, a department store and condominiums.\nKohn Pedersen Fox, which also designed Wanda’s One Nine Elms project in London, had sketched out a seven story atrium for Wang Jianlin’s first real estate foothold in the US. The 1.4 million square foot project would have provided 350,000 square feet of hotel space, 200,000 square feet of retail and 850,000 square feet of residential.\nIn what was perhaps a signal of frustrations with the New York project, Wang complained at the World Economic Forum in Davos in 2014 that, “If we compare [the United States and the European Union], the U.S. is more open than the EU,” he said. “But the U.K. is the most open,” according to an account by CNN.\nWanda’s failure to crack the NYC market presaged the collapse of its global dreams (Rendering by Kohn Pedersen Fox via newyorkyimby.com)\nDespite Wang’s US whining, Wanda went on to sign deals for projects in Chicago and Los Angeles. Those investments, like most of Wanda’s overseas projects now are either extinct or on the endangered list.\nIn January Wanda sold off for an undisclosed sum a pair of projects in Australia that it had once valued at $1.5 billion. That Aussie disposal came just one week after the Chinese developer had sold the site for its $1.1 billion One Nine Elms project for $82 million.\nWang’s Hollywood dreams also took a flurry of blows last year with a planned deal for a TV production company first running aground, before the company’s partner in movie studio Legendary Entertainment left the company. In October, Wanda’s US partner in its Los Angeles real estate project bailed out on the One Beverly Hills luxury condo-and-hotel complex, just before apartment sales were set to begin.\nWanda maintains an investment in the Wanda Vista Tower in Chicago, although media reports have suggested that the 94 story project is also on the market. And Wang Jianlin’s plans for a global hotel chain are as vacant as his would-be New York site, after Wanda sold 77 of its domestic hospitality assets to Guangzhou R&F last year for RMB 19.9 billion (then $2.9 billion).\nFiled Under: Design and Construction Tagged With: China outbound investment, Dalian Wanda Group, New York, US, Wang Jianlin, weekly-sp\nYour email address will not be published.

Geely and Fosun offer a clue\nThe main reason for the drop was a decline in Chinese investment in the US to US$29 billion from US$46 billion the year before. The drop would have been even steeper if it wasn’t for the US$18 billion in Chinese acquisitions announced in 2016 but completed last year, the report said.\nAmerican investment into China was almost unchanged at US$14 billion compared with US$13.8 billion in 2016.\nBeijing imposed a slew of new restrictions on outbound investment last year to address balance-of-payment concerns and minimise risks to the financial system stemming from debt-fuelled overseas spending.\nIn February China’s top economic planner published a list of “sensitive areas” where it intends to restrict overseas investments, putting a specific curb on deals related to property, hotels, cinemas, entertainment and sports clubs. Weapons development, manufacturing and maintenance, multinational water resources exploitation, and news media were also included on the list.\nChina’s biggest overseas acquirers to face tightened deal scrutiny by Beijing\nHowever, despite Beijing’s best efforts to contain investment flowing into these industries, the sectors that received the most Chinese FDI last year were real estate and hospitality (US$11 billion), transport and infrastructure (US$ 10 billion), and health and biotech (US$ 2.5 billion), according to another report compiled by the Rhodium Group released this week.\nChris Marlin, president of Florida-based Lennar International, which claims to be the US’ largest residential property developer by revenue, said his firm has been unaffected by Beijing’s capital outflow controls.\nThe company has “only experienced growth in our time dealing with [customers in] mainland China and the Asian region,” said Marlin, declining to give numbers.\nIncreased scrutiny of inbound deals by US authorities had also had an impact on FDI, the research found. The biggest such deal to fall through was aluminium giant China Zhongwang Holdings’ proposed US$2.3 billion acquisition of Aleris in November after regulators cancelled it over economic and national security concerns.\nIn terms of FDI flowing the other way, the report argues that China’s commitment to further market reforms is less certain now than it was in the years immediately after the 2013 “third plenum” talks in which the leadership promised a “decisive” role for markets in the economy. A perceived lack of progress in implementing change has left potential foreign investors with doubts about Beijing’s seriousness about levelling the playing field for non-native businesses, it said.\n“To date, even as hundreds of thousands Chinese receive paychecks from US companies, numerous sectors in China remain closed or restricted to foreign investment,” said Stephen Orlins, president of the National Committee on US-China Relations.\n“These restrictions do a disservice to the overwhelming majority of China’s people, as they not only drive up prices but also limit consumer choices. These restrictions contribute to a view in the US that China does not play fair.”\nThe report’s release coincides with the Boao Forum in the Chinese province of Hainan – known as China’s Davos – at which President Xi Jinping reiterated his commitment to opening markets and easing restrictions on foreign investment.\nOn Wednesday China’s central bank unveiled a raft of measures to open up the country’s financial sector to foreign investment, including the removal of foreign ownership caps for banks. Other key measures included allowing overseas investors to take a maximum 51 per cent equity stake in brokerage firms, futures companies and fund managers and completely removing caps on foreign equity in these sectors within three years.\nYou are signed up.

Jason and Tanya have fallen in love, yet cannot move forward together. Jason's life is at a stalemate: his feet cannot touch ground, his body afloat and directionless.

(16th March to 31st March 2019, Hong Kong Arts Centre Shouson Theatre)\n\nBlack Box Productions:\n\nThe Office\nWhile the staff in a company remains dutifully intent on self-protection, a shady transaction goes on behind the scenes. One day, the new janitor is embroiled in a tug-of-war between two members of staff, leading to a scuffle between junior and senior levels, reality and ideals, public and private.

(18th May to 2nd June 2018)\n\nThe Open Platform: Three Impaired Monkeys\nAn elderly father and his two sons share a small flat. The father's consciousness traverses past and present. He often re-enacts a family incident of which no one is aware, leading the sons to understand their father's devotion, and in turn, re-examining their own estranged relations. Families are a tapestry interwoven with thousands of strands of love and hate. The more people choose \"not to see, not to hear and not to speak,\" the veil of darkness becomes all the more apparent. Three Impaired Monkeys is written by Lai Yiu Ming and directed by Octavian Chan. (8th June to 18th June 2018)\n\nThe Open Platform: Castle of Glass\nSix amnesiacs are trapped in an unknown space. As if under a curse, they repeat their stories about the Fall of Hong Kong in 1941. An underground boss, a British officer, a Canadian soldier, a Japanese lieutenant, a young Chinese soldier and an old merchant step closer and closer to their destiny as they try to discover a hidden secret. Castle of Glass, a new drama written by Marcus Au and directed by Tony Wong, is a fable, perhaps also a prophecy. (23rd November to 2nd December 2018)\n\nHong Kong International Black Box Festival - Becoming Real (Co-presented by HKRep & West Kowloon Cultural District)\n\nNew Youth Group (Beijing) - One Fine Day\nBeijing-based director Li Jianjun uses elements of everyday life to create his alternative theatrical experiences. Rather than using professionally trained, well-rehearsed actors, he has 19 normal urban dwellers each describing \"one fine day\" while the audience equipped with personal headphones can choose which story to listen to at any given time. Everyone holds a key to open the secret chambers in each of their hearts, finding empathy in the process. One Fine Day has already touched the hearts of audiences in Beijing, Shanghai and Hangzhou. Those who took part were inspired to ponder such issues as personal relationships and how people relate to society. An open call for participants will be organised for the Hong Kong premiere of One Fine Day. We aim to discover people and events that are quintessentially Hong Kong.

Tickets for its 2016 Taipei Arts Festival presentation sold out at record speed. (17th October to 21st October 2018)\n\nPost/ HKRep (Australia / Hong Kong) - Oedipus Schmoedipus\nTwo Australian artists-Zoë Coombs Marr and Mish Grigor-resurrect classic drama in Oedipus Schmoedipus, spinning lines, plots and symbolism drawn from masterworks dealing with the subject of death into a brand-new, fun-filled performance. What makes this production even more glorious is that apart from Coombs Marr and Grigor playing host, 25 members of the public are enlisted to take part in each show. With only a few hours' rehearsal on the day of performance, their appearance adds much excitement, making the Oedipus Schmoedipus experience totally unique. (26th October to 29th October 2018)\n\nMilo Rau / International Institute of Political Murder / CAMPO (Switzerland / Germany / Belgium) - Five Easy Pieces\nCelebrated Swiss director Milo Rau's Five Easy Pieces daringly involves seven children under 13, casting them through simple exercises in roles associated with a notorious 1990s case of a serial killer. The drama alludes to the mass demonstration of 30,000 against Belgium's corrupt judiciary. It also examines how children, through their actions, grapple with serious questions about morality. Voted as the top of the \"Top 10\" of the Berliner Festspiele-Theatertreffen 2017, Five Easy Pieces has toured Singapore and more than a dozen countries in Europe, catapulting this work to popular acclaim.

A hefty tariff on Chinese steel is being floated while Chinese aluminium is rumoured to be on the chopping block. At Davos, the US Treasury secretary was talking down an already weak dollar. Are we seeing the start of a long-feared trade war between the US and East Asia, especially China?\nI suspect this is not a real trade war. The Trump administration doesn’t have a strategy to go all the way. The US economy depends on a vast stock market bubble and foreign financing of its fiscal deficit. Its tax cut is adding US$1.5 trillionto its deficit over the next decade, making it more dependent on foreign capital. If the US goes deep into a trade war or debasing the dollar, the stock market will crash, foreign money will flee, its bond yield will surge and its economy will crash.\nA credible trade war requires two elements: the US being prepared for a prolonged recession, and a coherent industrial policy. The US economy is driven by maximising short-term profitability for big listed companies. They have been driving the outsourcing model in global trade because cutting costs through outsourcing is the quickest way to boost profit. The high stock prices from the boosted earnings reward the top managers at these companies. The US CEOs have seen incredible increases in their incomes, far ahead of their counterparts in Germany and Japan, while its industrial workers face declining wages. Unless the US changes the incentive structure for its top corporate managers, this dynamic won’t change.\nGermany and Japan, while they don’t publicly admit it, have industrial policies. They concentrate resources in industries where they could achieve long-term competitiveness. Their CEOs put the country’s interest ahead of short-term profitability. And, they don’t pay themselves tens of millions of dollars, because their societies have implicit social contracts against it. They are still high-cost countries and can’t achieve high economic growth. But, a deep industrial base leads to a more stable and equitable economy.\nThe ongoing trade dispute with China continues the decades-long pattern in how the US handles its trade with the East. Four decades ago, the anti-Japan rhetoric was more heated than that against China today. Far more serious restrictions were imposed on Japanese steel, automobiles and electronic products. They have had no impact on how industrial development has evolved on both sides. What has changed is that industries have moved from one Asian country to another.\nEast Asia’s advantage in manufacturing is not just labour cost. Its labour quality is superior to that of the US. Even more important is cheap capital. East Asia has a high savings rate and accounts for most of the net savings in the world. Any capital-intensive industry is likely to be rooted there. An industry such as semiconductors may start in the US, but eventually becomes a typical East Asian industry, because it is capital intensive. This advantage in capital may be exaggerated by financial repression that boosts savings. Countries like China should eliminate financial repression. Still, even when government policy doesn’t tilt the savings rate one way or another, East Asia will have higher savings rates.\nAnglo-Saxon economies like the US, Britain and Australia practise the opposite of financial repression. Their financial markets tend to exaggerate paper wealth and encourage borrowing. Hence, they have an unusually low savings rate and high cost of capital. This is a key reason that Germany and Japan have stronger industries. If the US wants to reindustrialise, it must first stop excessive monetary stimulus that encourages debt.\nUS President Donald Trump’s protectionist policy will at best prolong the life of sunset industries like steel and aluminium. As the capital market sees their high cost, it will hold back and they will just wither away. For a new industry like solar panels, it will merely encourage tariff arbitrage. Some companies will start local assembly operations with imported components, mostly from China, similar to what developing countries used to do.\nA real trade war could occur only if the US’ asset bubble bursts and the Federal Reserve cannot start a new one. That would mean a prolonged recession. The nascent populist movement that got Trump elected could become a dominant force and completely change the country’s ruling elite. That is a possibility but not likely, at least in the next decade. The financial bubbles over the past three decades have created a powerful and extremely wealthy class. It is difficult to see that they will give up easily and see their wealth deflate under a new regime.\nThe US will stick to the whack-a-mole approach in its protectionist policy. It may scare the other parties into doing a few things to boost US exports, but the big picture won’t change. The US will continue to run large trade deficit until East Asian countries don’t want dollars any more. When that day comes, the dollar will collapse, and the US will slide into stagflation, while East Asian economies will be stuck with deflation.\nAndy Xie is an independent economist\nYou are signed up.

And the second stop is China Academy of Space Technology on Tuesday.\nLanding spacecraft on Mars is full of complexities, with generally a less than 40 percent success rate in the world, Lin Yiming, senior vice-president of China Academy of Space Technology, said Tuesday.\nHowever, China plans to land Chinese spacecraft on Mars in 2021 to have a closer look at the planet, he added.\nIn addition to this plan, Xie Jun, chief engineer for the third-generation Beidou satellites at the academy, said that the third-generation Beidou satellite must remain China-made to ensure the project won't be delayed due to lacks of parts made abroad.\nOn Nov 5, the first two third-generation Beidou satellites were launched atop a Long March 3B carrier rocket from Xichang Satellite Launch Center in Sichuan province, marking the beginning of its global coverage.\nBeidou is the world's fourth navigation satellite system, following GPS in the United States, GLONASS in Russia and Galileo in the European Union.\nAccording to Xie, China will launch 18 third-generation Beidou satellites into space to offer navigation services to countries involved in the Belt and Road Initiative. And the whole global network is planned to be completed based on 35 satellites before the end of 2020.\nThe China-proposed initiative comprises the Silk Road Economic Belt and the 21st Century Maritime Silk Road, which aim to build trade and infrastructure networks connecting Asia with Europe and Africa on and beyond the ancient Silk Road routes.\nMeanwhile, Xie also said that there is much work to be done in terms of improving signal services and product quality as well as popularizing Beidou-matched ground devices.\nEstablished in 1968ï¼the academy is the birthplace of many \"firsts\" in space, such as China's first artificial earth satellite, first manned spacecraft and first lunar probe.

[Wang Biao/for China Daily]\nThis section of society has become a major economic presence, feeling more secure emotionally and financially with rising disposable income\nThey are still young, confident and single with money to spend on designer living and brand name products.\nInternet shopping is part of their daily lives with door-to-door food deliveries. Online gaming and pets address their emotional needs, while eating out is more than a treat.\nUp to 77 million adults live alone, an increase of 16 percent compared to 2012. By 2021, this number is expected to reach 92 million, data from marketing consultancy Euromonitor revealed.\nNaturally, this market is now worth billions of dollars with online giant Alibaba Group Holding Ltd reporting that products targeting \"singles only\" jumped 5.6 times last year compared to 2015.\n\"A major trend involves products and services that are tailor-made for singles such as mini refrigerators, small-sized high-end retail stores providing imported goods, and smaller apartments,\" said Liao Tianshu, managing director of Boston Consulting Group Greater China.\nPart of the reason behind this is the decision by affluent singles to marry later in life, especially in major metropolises.\nIn 2014, the average age of men getting married in Shanghai was around 30. For women, it was about 28, according to the Shanghai Civil Affairs Bureau.\nThis might have something to do with the fact that China's four biggest cities, Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou and Shenzhen, also have the highest divorce rates.\nResearch by the Boston Consulting Group showed that about 16 percent of the urban population in China live alone.\n\"The concept of being single is no longer negative, and it's natural for them to dine and travel by themselves,\" BCG stated in a report.\nDuring the past two decades, they have also become wealthy and a key component of China's middle class.\nSingle holidays are booming, while food delivery services and restaurants have rolled out services to fit into their busy lifestyles.\nTo cater for this niche market, the Haidilao hot pot chain based in Sichuan province has come up with an innovative move at its 200 restaurants.\nFluffy toy bears sit next to single diners so they do not look so alone.\n\"Services provided by (outlets such as) Haidilao are tailored for single diners,\" said Neil Wang, president of consulting firm Frost & Sullivan in China.\n\"Other restaurant brands have also launched similar services, such as providing set meals and seating places for one person,\" he added.\nApart from the decision to push back plans to marry, singles appear more confident about their financial prospects and their emotional feelings.\nMany have spent years in further education and that is starting to pay off, as far as their careers are concerned.\n\"The main reason for the increasing number of singles is because people are financially and emotionally feeling more secure on their own,\" said Alina Ma, senior research analyst at the global consultancy Mintel Group Ltd.\n\"Economic and social development contributes significantly in eliminating insecurity issues caused by the lack of a partner,\" she added.\nA survey released by the World Economic Forum earlier this year underlined the point that today's singles are better off than the previous generation and are willing to spend.\nThe WEF report showed this section of society was under the age of 35 and spent 40 percent more on various products than their predecessors with the same income.\nIn a poll conducted by Mintel, movies, television shows, traveling and fitness regimes were the three most discussed topics among Chinese singles.\n\"This is partly because they need to enliven their lives and the result of the booming Chinese entertainment industry,\" Ma at Mintel said.\nZhai Chunming is a regular moviegoer, despite the heavy workload as an English teacher at a privately-owned institution in Beijing.\nHe loves his visits to the cinema and believes the experiences enrich his life.\n\"I am used to going to the cinema on my own,\" the 31-year-old said. \"The good thing is there is no limit on the genre of the movie or when to go.\n\"I can even watch a movie at midnight and no one will interrupt me to chat about the film,\" Zhai added. \"These are the blessings of being single. If I need to discuss my views about the movie, I can do it online.\"\nLifestyle retailers, such as Japan's Ryohin Keikaku Co Ltd or Muji, have been quick to move into the singles market by selling small rice cookers, ovens and kettles.\n\"Not only manufacturers have launched special-size products tailored for singles, but service providers are also moving into the sector,\" Wang at Frost & Sullivan said.\n\"For example, more real estate agencies have introduced single rental apartments,\" he added.\n\n"}

The relative quiet in the currency markets may soon end\nComments:\n\nThe turmoil in global stock markets is intensifying by the day.\nLast Friday, US equities suffered one of their sharpest daily declines since an outbreak of volatility swept through markets earlier this year. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, a leading US equity index, dipped back into correction territory, having fallen more than 10 per cent since its peak on January 26.\nWhile the turbulence was initially triggered by fears about a faster-than-anticipated withdrawal of monetary stimulus, the severe escalation in trade tensions between Washington and Beijing has become the main source of anxiety, fuelled by growing concerns that President Donald Trump’s administration is now led by “China hawks”, presided over by Trump himself.\nWhat way out for Hong Kong in US-China trade war?\nYet despite the upheaval in stock markets, one of the world’s largest and most actively traded asset classes, the US$5 trillion-a-day foreign exchange market, has been remarkably unperturbed.\nThe VIX Index, Wall Street’s “fear gauge” which measures the anticipated volatility in the benchmark S&P 500 equity index, has surged since late January and currently stands close to its level during the panic sparked by the surprise devaluation of the renminbi in August 2015. Meanwhile, the JPMorgan Global FX Volatility Index, a benchmark for implied volatility across currency markets, has fallen since mid-February and has just experienced its third successive weekly decline.\nIn a note published on Friday, JPMorgan rightly observed that currency markets, which are influenced mainly by developments in monetary policy, “have been sidelined and [have been] something of a sideshow to developments in other markets in recent months”.\nThe clearest example of this has been the relative stability of the US dollar, with the dollar index, a gauge of the performance of the greenback against a basket of other major currencies, “confined to a range of less than 2 per cent for almost three months”, JPMorgan noted, in the face of the tariff-fuelled turmoil in equity markets.\nThe index has even risen since early February, by nearly 1.5 per cent, despite the persistent bearishness towards the dollar, evidenced by the results of last month’s global fund manager survey, by Bank of America Merrill Lynch, showing that the “short dollar” trade – bets against the greenback – remains the second most crowded trade behind wagers on a further rally in technology stocks.\nMoreover, the halt in the dollar’s decline – the index plunged by 14 per cent between the start of 2017 and the end of January this year – comes at a time when a confluence of factors point to a revival in the greenback’s fortunes.\n\nThe most obvious one is the fact that the dollar, which had become significantly overvalued by the end of 2015 following a 1½-year-long bull run stemming from expectations of a rise in US interest rates, has already undergone a significant correction (especially against the euro). It is now cheaper versus other major currencies.\nMore importantly, one of the key catalysts for a weaker greenback – the perceived convergence in global monetary policies as the world’s other main central banks prepare the ground for a withdrawal of stimulus – is losing momentum.\nWhy 2018 could be the year of the US dollar\nThe euro zone, which grew at a much faster-than-expected pace last year, is now expanding at its slowest rate since early 2017. IHS Markit, a data provider, says the bloc’s economy “came off the boil in March”. Moreover, core inflation (which strips out volatile food and energy prices) remains stuck at 1 per cent – half the target of the European Central Bank. In Japan, meanwhile, the central bank’s inflation target is even further out of reach.\nThe normalisation of monetary policy in Europe and Japan has become a more distant prospect than appeared to be the case only several months ago. This increases the scope for the dollar to benefit from a much more hawkish Federal Reserve, which anticipates further rate hikes later this year amid a pick-up in inflation.\nEra of cheap money simply has to end\nStrong US dollar likely to be early casualty in Trump’s trade wars\nThe dollar could also gain from the threat of a trade war between the US and China if, as Morgan Stanley believes, it results in an outcome that ends up lowering America’s hefty trade deficit.\nStill, dollar bears have reasons to be confident. While the greenback is cheaper, it is still overvalued. As I noted in an earlier column, the dollar has also failed to act as a reliable safe haven during periods of turmoil, partly because of the US’ rapidly deteriorating fiscal position. Trump’s nationalist and protectionist policies only add to the greenback’s woes.\nThe fact that the outlook for the dollar has become more uncertain adds to the growing number of risks in markets – particularly in developing economies, which have benefited significantly from the dollar’s decline.\nGlobal currency markets are unlikely to remain a sideshow for much longer.\nNicholas Spiro is a partner for Lauressa Advisory\nYou are signed up.

Earlier this week, just as Saudi Arabia declared an anti-corruption purge that targeted some of the kingdom’s wealthiest and most powerful men, guests were booted out and reservations were cancelled.\nTravel agents were told the palatial compound had been taken over for government use.\nSaudis gleefully shared screenshots showing the hotel as fully booked, because word was that the VIP detainees – including billionaire Prince Alwaleed bin Talal, 10 other princes, four ministers and dozens of former officials and businessmen – were being held there. People have been quipping about who’s going to be added to the “Ritz guest list”.\n\nThe government’s Centre for International Communication did not respond to a request for comment on where the detainees are being held.\nJust weeks ago, the hotel hosted some of the world’s top officials and businessmen for an investment conference dubbed “Davos in the desert”. On a typical day, the lobby is an informal salon of government officials, consultants and prominent businessmen who hobnob over high tea in halls decorated with leaping bronze horses and pastel trimmings in the style of Louis XIV gone wild. Guests who float in the extravagant indoor pool – male-only – look up at a painted blue sky dotted with clouds.\nBut on Sunday, the property was shut tight, its massive gates uncharacteristically closed, without a security guard in sight. The hotel’s main phone line has played a busy tone all week. A duty manager reached on a mobile number said the hotel was closed and he had no further information. Marriott, which operates the hotel, declined to comment, citing guest privacy.\n\nWhoever has booked the entire hotel must have decided they need more time. On Sunday, an online search on the hotel’s website showed the next availability on December 1. By Tuesday, it was December 15. On Wednesday, it was February.\nThat will give guests time to save up. When the hotel reopens, the royal suite will be available for 20,000 riyals (US$5,332) a night.\nSaudi crown prince Mohammed bin Salman’s aggressive power grab represents a huge gamble on the stability of his kingdom and its neighbours.\nNo one is quite sure whether MBS’ bold move will leave him as the uncontested leader of a more modern, open Saudi Arabia – or open the door to chaos, rebellion or a regional war. But US President Donald Trump is along for the ride.\n\n“I have great confidence in King Salman and the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia, they know exactly what they are doing,” Trump tweeted on Monday, after a round of high-profile arrests.\nThe arrests were the first order by an anti-graft commission headed by Prince Mohammed himself, and many outside observers saw it as a politicised move against rivals within the elite.\nTrump, who has tangled publicly with Al-Waleed in the past, had no such doubts, declaring: “Some of those they are harshly treating have been ‘milking’ their country for years!”\nMBS’ made his move as he aims to accelerate his Vision 2030 project to modernise the conservative kingdom, but also as Riyadh takes a more aggressive stance in its wider region.\nSaudi-led forces are waging a fierce war against Iran-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen and Riyadh has led its allies in a boycott of Gulf emirate Qatar, to growing US frustration.\nIn the wake of an alleged Houthi missile attack against Riyadh airport, the kingdom has accused Iran of “direct aggression” and threatened an equally direct though unspecified response. And Riyadh was deeply involved in Lebanese premier Saad Hariri’s decision to resign his post and flee to the kingdom, precipitating a new political crisis in Beirut.\nSome might see this string of crises as headaches the already tumultuous Middle East could do without, but Washington is still standing four square behind its ally.\n“We continue to encourage Saudi authorities to pursue the prosecution of people they believe to have been corrupt officials,” State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said. “We expect them to do it in a fair and transparent manner.”\nLori Plotkin Boghardt, an expert in Gulf Arab politics and US-Saudi relations at The Washington Institute, said the need for an anti-corruption drive “should not be dismissed.”\nNevertheless, she addED: “The scale and scope of the arrests … is unprecedented in recent Saudi history, especially of this type of elite elements. So this is a politically risky move.”\nAdditional reporting by Agence France-Presse\nYou are signed up. We think you'd also like\n"}

It is extremely likely that human influence has been the dominant cause of the observed warming since the mid-20th century.”\nInterested readers are referred to the Summary for Policymakers (Section D.3) of the IPCC Fifth Assessment Report and the underlying chapters, in particular, Chapter 10. Mr Crawley also distorted the message on the so-called “slowdown” in temperature rise.\nQuoting from Chapter 1: “Even though the projections from the models were never intended to be predictions over such a short timescale, the observations through 2012 generally fall within the projections made in all past assessments.”\nTypical of those suffering from denial syndrome, your correspondent seems to take comfort in the fact that 2017 is not as hot as 2015 and 2016.\nAccording to the World Meteorological Organisation, 2017 is set to be among the top three hottest years, that is, the three hottest years on record, 2015, 2016 and 2017 – occurring in a row. The global average temperature for 2013-2017 is likely to be the highest five-year average on record.\nThe current rate of sea level rise is about 3.2mm/year (climate.nasa.gov/vital-signs/sea-level). The average rate of sea level rise during the satellite altimetry era is about twice the average during the 20th century, which is much higher than the average for the last two millennia (Chapter 5 of the IPCC’s assessment report).\nMr Crawley suggested the Paris Agreement would not change anything. His suggestion would certainly come true if “clear-thinking” people all think like him, instead of taking proactive action to reduce carbon emissions.\nLee Sai Ming, senior scientific officer, Hong Kong Observatory\nYou are signed up.

Speak. Louder.” is its official motto.\nIn a letter to members posted on its website on Friday, CEO Gayle Smith said that between 2011 and 2015 staff in South Africa were bullied, berated and belittled by managers.\n‘It was like a full-on Caligula orgy’: Oxfam staff hired Haitian prostitutes during 2011 relief effort\nIn one instance, a supervisor made her employees work as party hostesses at her home on weekends.\nThe letter also says a female employee alleged that a supervisor made sexist and suggestive comments about her to a government official, and that she was demoted after refusing to have sex with the dignitary.\n\nSmith, who joined the organisation in March 2017, said One Campaign learned about the allegations after the employees, who have all left, shared their grievances on social media in November last year. Smith wrote that the organisation then launched an internal investigation.\nThe sexual harassment allegations are so far uncorroborated, Smith wrote, but she stressed that the organisation does not “discount any allegation”.\nInvestigators were able to substantiate claims of bullying and harassment that included instances of the Johannesburg manager calling her staff names including “idiot”, ‘’stupid” and “worthless”,\nThe report also found that executive managers were made aware of the abuse, through emails and complaints filed through human resources but failed to stop it.\n“The overall evidence from our investigation was sufficient for me to conclude that we needed to own an institutional failure and ensure that our organisation has in place the systems, policies and practices needed so that this never happens again,” Smith wrote.\nSmith said both the employees who alleged the abuse and all leadership and executive management responsible for perpetrating abuses are no longer with the organisation.\nThe letter comes on the heels of reports of misconduct within other UK-based charities.\nAnti-poverty charity Oxfam has come under fire over allegations that staff working in Haiti following a devastating 2010 earthquake hired prostitutes.\nThe deputy executive director of Unicef, a children’s aid foundation, recently resigned after he was accused of acting inappropriately towards female staff while working at a different charity, Save the Children.\nMore than 1,000 women recently signed an open letter calling for increased accountability surrounding sexual harassment and assault in the aid sector, with the hashtags #ReformAid and #AidToo.\nCharities must abide by the highest standards\nSmith wrote that she has introduced new systems to help ensure accountability, including hiring a new executive director for Africa and planning to place a human resources manager on site in South Africa.\n“We’ve got an obligation to find out how we do better,” Smith said.\nA spokesman for One Campaign said Bono was made aware of the findings in November, soon after the former employees tweeted about them.\nYou are signed up.

But inside it is a virtual jungle where rooms and corridors are lined with more than 7,000 potted plants and creepers.\nThe greenhouse terrace, with artificial grass and green walls, houses an “air washing” system that moves polluted outside air through a series of cleaning filters.\nIt is then pushed through the greenhouse where the plants remove bacteria, fungus, carbon dioxide and other toxins, before the air conditioning pumps it to workers on the floors below.\n“It would be like working in Gulmarg in Kashmir or Davos in Switzerland in this building,” 73-year-old Meattle said as he looked out at the smog from the protection of the lush rooftop nursery.\n“You are actually right now sitting in an air tank,” he said, referring to the greenhouse where PM2.5 – the most harmful particulates in the air – registered nearly zero compared with 415 outside, according to Paharpur’s monitoring system.\nThe outside level is more than 16 times the World Health Organisation’s safe limit.\nA Massachusetts Institute of Technology graduate and trustee of Al Gore’s Climate Reality Project, Meattle began thinking about a clean office project years ago when he rejected doctors’ advice to move away from the polluted capital for his health.\n“I wanted a solution for myself and I didn’t want to leave Delhi,” he said.\nHis centre, whose tenants include Amazon, Samsung and Microsoft, is now rated the city’s healthiest building by the Indian government, and Meattle says people who work there benefit from improved blood oxygen levels, better brain function, and fewer asthma and eye irritation cases.\nDelhi chokes every winter as cool air traps a toxic blend of pollutants from crop burning, car exhausts, open fires, construction dust and industrial emissions close to the ground.\nThe annual scourge has been particularly bad this season, and short-term measures – such as shutting factories and restricting car use – have failed to have a significant impact.\nIn November, doctors declared a public health emergency and schools were shut across the capital.\nFumes from backup generators are a central ingredient in the noxious cocktail, but one company is turning them into ink and paint with technology that can capture up to 90 per cent of dangerous pollutants.\nChakr Innovations, started by graduates from the Indian Institute of Technology, has capitalised on the smoke-belching machines that can be heard across the city.\nIts Chakr Shield is fitted to generators and converts carbon and other fine particles, including the most harmful PM0.3 and PM2.5 specks, into liquefied soot through chemical and heat-exchanging processes. The captured carbon is washed down with a solvent and processed into ink pigment and paints.\n“What would have otherwise been a waste is captured and reborn to be used as a raw material again,” said co-founder Arpit Dhupar, donning a T-shirt that says “black is the new green”.\nDhupar was inspired by seeing a diesel generator that was running a roadside sugar cane juice stall and turning the wall behind it black in the process.\nChakr has fitted machines at more than 18 Delhi offices, and 30 other companies have signed up for the technology, including US giant Dell Computers, which will be using Chakr’s ink for printing on its cardboard boxes.\nDhupar said that in 18 months, the machines had collected enough carbon to pollute about 1.5 billion litres of air.\n“We are running out of clean, breathable air in Delhi and our definitive objective is to make the access to clean air a basic right for everyone,” he said.\nOthers want to ensure that right extends to animals, including the high-performance ponies that compete on Delhi’s thriving polo circuit.\nThe Army Polo and Riding Club recently ruled that horses used by the Delhi Army polo team must be allowed twice as many breaks to alleviate the physical stress of playing matches in toxic conditions.\n“By sheer logic and the levels of pollution that were there in Delhi we thought that it may cause a problem. The longer the pony plays, the exhaustion is that much higher,” said the club’s chief executive, Colonel Ravi Rathore.\nYou are signed up. We think you'd also like\n"}

A population in the grip of opium addiction. An economy held back by bureaucracy and crumbling infrastructure. A culture fixated on past greatness but hopelessly decadent. This was how Westerners in the 18th and 19th centuries regarded China. It is how the Chinese (and most Europeans) now regard the United States.\nEver since President Xi Jinping’s triumphant appearance as defender of free trade and champion of globalisation at the World Economic Forum in Davos in January, there has been a trend: commentators most averse to Donald Trump tend to be most gushing in their praise of his Chinese counterpart.\nTo The Economist, Xi is now “the world’s most powerful man”. Xi offers a “long-term view of China’s ambition”, declared The Financial Times last week. “This president has an iron grip on power and a strategy to reach global pre-eminence.”\nFareed Zakaria, of CNN, wrote almost rhapsodically about the implications of the 19th party congress, which ended last week: “This party congress made clear that [Xi] is no ordinary leader. For the rest of his life, Xi and his ideas will dominate the Communist Party of China.”\n\nTo the author of The Post-American World, the implications are clear. “These changes are ... occurring against the backdrop of the total collapse of political and moral authority of the United States in the world. China [has] signalled that it now sees itself as the world’s other superpower, positioning itself as the alternative, if not rival, to the United States.”\nThis point was seemingly lost on Trump, who tweeted that he had called Xi “to congratulate him on his extraordinary elevation”.\nWe’re supposed to be impressed that, to quote The Economist, Xi’s “grip on China is tighter than any leader’s since Mao”? Mao was responsible for the deaths of millions in the 1949 revolution, the Great Leap Forward and the Cultural Revolution. If Mao is Xi’s model, China is more likely to become a vast North Korea than a post-American colossus.\n\nLet’s get three things straight about events in Beijing last week. Xi is the first leader since Mao to have his “thought” put into the Chinese constitution while he is still in office. Deng Xiaoping’s “theory” was not inserted until after his death. Moreover, in China, “thought” ranks above “theory”.\nBut what is Xi’s thought? The relevant amendment to the constitution runs to nearly 3,000 words, but in essence it combines the familiar (“socialism with Chinese characteristics”) with new themes introduced by Xi: “the Chinese dream of national rejuvenation”, “green development”, anti-corruption and the party’s primacy over the military.\nNot much here is Maoist: “We shall give play to the decisive role of market forces in resource allocation ... advance extensive, multilevel and institutionalised development of consultative democracy ... [and] enhance our country’s cultural soft power.”\nSecond, the politics. Is Xi now all-powerful? No. He is primus inter pares on the seven-member Politburo Standing Committee. The new line-up confirmed this. Premier Li Keqiang remained, and Wang Yang and Han Zheng joined, despite being associated with former presidents Hu Jintao and Jiang Zemin.\n\nThird, we still don’t know what Xi will do with his enhanced authority. Key appointments in economic policy and finance will not be announced until March. Maybe long-awaited structural reforms and deleveraging will finally arrive. Or maybe vested interests within state-owned enterprises will again stave off their reckoning.\nIf the Chinese are lucky, Xi will turn out to be an enlightened absolutist, like Singapore’s Lee Kuan Yew. If they are unlucky, he will be another emperor who fondly dreamt of controlling a fifth of humanity. Worst case – but least likely – he’s Mao 2.0.\n\nMaybe modern information technology can give totalitarianism a new lease of life, as big Chinese tech companies make available the personal data of all Chinese netizens. Maybe, thanks to big data, economic planning can work where previously it failed. I wouldn’t bet on it. To judge by the amount of foreign investment wealthy Chinese are making in spite of tightened capital controls, neither would they.\nNiall Ferguson’s new book is The Square and the Tower: Networks, Hierarchies and the Struggle for Global Power\nYou are signed up.
